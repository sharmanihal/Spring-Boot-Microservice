# Accessing Property Values in Spring Boot Applications

In this tutorial, we will explore how to access values from property files in your Spring Boot application and use them in your code.

## Step 1: Create a Spring Boot Project

The first step in externalizing your microservice configurations is to place them in a configuration file and then read them in your application. Here is how you can do this:

1. Visit [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io) to create a new Spring Boot project.
2. Configure your Maven coordinates:
   - **Group:** `io.javaprints`
   - **Artifact:** `spring-boot-config`
3. Select the `Web` dependency and generate the project.
4. Open the generated project in IntelliJ IDEA.

## Step 2: Add Configuration to `application.properties`

Spring Boot projects include a default `application.properties` file in the `resources` folder. This file allows you to configure key-value pairs for your application.

Example:
```properties
my.greeting=Hello
```

The goal is to access this value in your code without hardcoding it.

## Step 3: Create a REST Controller

1. Create a new Java class named `GreetingController`.
2. Annotate it with `@RestController`.
3. Define a method to handle `/greeting` requests:

```java
@RestController
public class GreetingController {

    @GetMapping("/greeting")
    public String greeting() {
        return "Hello";
    }
}
```

This currently returns a hardcoded string `"Hello"`. Next, we will modify this to fetch the value from the `application.properties` file.

## Step 4: Use `@Value` Annotation to Inject Property Values

Spring provides the `@Value` annotation to inject property values into your classes. Follow these steps:

1. Add a private member variable:

   ```java
   private String greetingMessage;
   ```

2. Annotate it with `@Value`:

   ```java
   @Value("${my.greeting}")
   private String greetingMessage;
   ```

3. Update the `greeting()` method to return this value:

   ```java
   @GetMapping("/greeting")
   public String greeting() {
       return greetingMessage;
   }
   ```

When you run the application and access `http://localhost:8080/greeting`, it will return the value from the `application.properties` file, e.g., `Hello`.

## Step 5: Reference Properties in Other Properties

Property files can reference other properties using the `${}` syntax. For example:

```properties
app.name=MyApp
app.description=Welcome to ${app.name}
```

Spring resolves `app.description` as `Welcome to MyApp` automatically.

## Limitations of Internalized Properties

Although moving configurations to a `properties` file decouples them from the code, the file is bundled inside the generated JAR. This limits the ability to modify the properties without rebuilding the application.

### Next Steps

In the next tutorial, we will discuss how to externalize properties further, allowing configurations to reside outside the JAR, making them easier to manage and update without requiring application recompilation.
