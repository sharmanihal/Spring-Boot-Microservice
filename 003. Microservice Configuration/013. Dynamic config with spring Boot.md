# Dynamic Configuration Refresh in Microservices

In this tutorial, we will learn how to refresh configuration properties for your microservices in real-time without restarting them. Let’s dive in!

## Overview of Externalized Configuration
1. **Externalized Configuration**: Configuration is managed externally using property files and Spring profiles.
2. **Consistent Configuration**: Centralized using Spring Cloud Config Server.
3. **Version History**: Managed through a Git repository.

The challenge: Normally, when you make changes to configuration properties, you must restart your microservices because properties are read only when the application starts. We aim to avoid this by enabling dynamic refresh.

## Problem Statement
When a property file is updated in the Git repository:
- **Spring Cloud Config Server** immediately reflects the changes.
- **Client applications** do not automatically fetch updated values.

By design, clients cache configurations to save processing resources. This tutorial shows how to dynamically refresh clients without restarting them.

## Steps to Enable Dynamic Refresh

### 1. Add Actuator Dependency
Add the `spring-boot-starter-actuator` dependency to your project’s `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Actuator exposes several useful endpoints, including one for triggering a refresh.

### 2. Expose the Refresh Endpoint
Allow all Actuator endpoints by setting the following property in `application.properties` or `application.yml`:

```properties
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*
```

### 3. Use the `@RefreshScope` Annotation
Mark the beans or components that use the externalized properties with the `@RefreshScope` annotation. This ensures their dependencies (i.e., configuration values) are refreshed when a refresh is triggered.

Example:

```java
@RestController
@RefreshScope
public class GreetingController {

    @Value("${greeting.message}")
    private String greetingMessage;

    @GetMapping("/greet")
    public String greet() {
        return greetingMessage;
    }
}
```

## Demonstration

### Setup
1. **Config Server**: Hosts the configuration files in a Git repository.
2. **Client Application**: Fetches configuration from the Config Server.

### Process

1. **Modify the Configuration**
   - Update the `application.yml` file in the Git repository.
   - Example:

     ```yaml
     greeting:
       message: "Newly Updated Greeting"
     ```

   - Commit the change to the Git repository.

2. **Check Config Server**
   - Verify that the Config Server reflects the updated configuration by accessing:
     ```
     http://localhost:8888/{application-name}/{profile}
     ```

3. **Trigger Refresh in Client**
   - Use a tool like Postman to send a POST request to the `/actuator/refresh` endpoint:
     ```
     POST http://localhost:8080/actuator/refresh
     Content-Type: application/json
     ```

4. **Verify the Update**
   - Access the client’s endpoint to confirm the updated configuration:
     ```
     http://localhost:8080/greet
     ```
   - The response should reflect the updated value.

## Key Takeaways
1. **Dependency on Actuator**: Provides the endpoint to trigger a refresh.
2. **`@RefreshScope` Annotation**: Ensures beans using configuration properties are refreshed dynamically.
3. **Manual or Automated Refresh**: Post requests can be triggered manually or automated using monitoring systems.

With these steps, you’ve achieved dynamic configuration refresh in your microservices. Stay tuned for the next tutorial, where we’ll discuss strategies for managing multiple configuration sources effectively.
