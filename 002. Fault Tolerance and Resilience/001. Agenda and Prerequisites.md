# Microservices with Spring Boot: Fault Tolerance and Resilience

## Agenda
In this workshop, we will focus on understanding fault tolerance and resilience in microservices. Here’s a high-level overview of what we will cover:

### 1. **Challenges with Availability in Microservices**
   - We will explore the challenges faced when maintaining availability in microservices.
   - Why is fault tolerance and resilience important in microservices?

### 2. **Understanding the Problems**
   - We will dive into the fundamental concepts that form the basis of fault tolerance and resilience.
   - Even if you don’t take away specific technologies like Spring Boot or Hystrix, understanding the core concepts is crucial and will apply to any microservices framework.

### 3. **Using Spring Boot and Hystrix**
   - After understanding the problems, we will take a sample project and apply Spring Boot and Hystrix.
   - We will see how to make microservices more resilient and fault-tolerant using these frameworks.

## Course Layers
- The agenda is simple but layered. We will dig deep into availability challenges and explore various ways to make microservices more available and fault-tolerant.
- This workshop will help you understand the **why** and **how** of fault tolerance in microservices.

## Prerequisite Knowledge
- This course is a **Level 2** course focused on fault tolerance and resilience.
- There is a **Level 1** course on **Communication and Service Discovery**. It is recommended that you complete that course first or at least have exposure to it before diving into this course. 

## Conclusion
- This course will equip you with the knowledge to handle fault tolerance and resilience in microservices.
- We will leverage Spring Boot and Hystrix to implement the discussed concepts.
- Make sure you are ready to learn how to make your microservices more robust and reliable.
