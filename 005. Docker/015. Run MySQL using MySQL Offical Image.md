# Running MySQL with Docker

In this tutorial, we will explore how to run MySQL on a local machine using Docker. Instead of installing MySQL traditionally, we'll be using Docker for a modern and efficient approach.

## Steps to Run MySQL with Docker

### 1. Install Docker
Ensure that Docker is installed on your local machine. If not, follow the installation steps for your operating system from the official Docker website.

### 2. Find the MySQL Image
We will use the official MySQL Docker image, which can be found on Docker Hub. Visit the [MySQL Docker Hub page](https://hub.docker.com/_/mysql) to access the official image.

### 3. Pull MySQL Image
Once Docker is installed, you need to pull the MySQL image using the following command:

```bash
docker pull mysql
```

This command will download the MySQL image from Docker Hub to your local machine.

### 4. Run MySQL Container
After pulling the image, run the MySQL container using this command:

```bash
docker run mysql:5.7
```

Note that `5.7` is the version we're using in this example.

### 5. Set Up MySQL with Environment Variables
To set up the MySQL container, you must provide certain environment variables, such as the root password, database name, user, and user password.

The following command will set up the MySQL container with environment variables:

```bash
docker run -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root_password -e MYSQL_DATABASE=todos -e MYSQL_USER=todos-user -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=dummytodos -d mysql:5.7
```

Explanation of Environment Variables:
- `MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD`: Sets the root password for MySQL.
- `MYSQL_DATABASE`: Creates a database named "todos".
- `MYSQL_USER`: Creates a user with the name "todos-user".
- `MYSQL_PASSWORD`: Sets the password for the user "todos-user".
- `-d`: Runs the container in detached mode (the terminal is freed up after the container starts).

### 6. Check Running Containers
To check if the MySQL container is running, use the following command:

```bash
docker container list
```

### 7. Connect to MySQL
To connect to the MySQL server running in the Docker container, use the MySQL Shell or any MySQL client.

- Install MySQL Shell from the [official MySQL website](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/shell/), or use a MySQL client of your choice.

In the terminal, run the following to connect:

```bash
mysqlsh
```

Use the following command in MySQL Shell to connect to the MySQL database:

```bash
\connect todos-user@localhost:3306
```

Enter the password (`dummytodos` in this case) when prompted.

### 8. Expose Ports
By default, MySQL containers run on port `3306`. If you can't connect to MySQL using `localhost:3306`, it may be because the container's port is not exposed to the local machine.

To expose the port, use the `-p` option when starting the Docker container:

```bash
docker run -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root_password -e MYSQL_DATABASE=todos -e MYSQL_USER=todos-user -e MYSQL_PASSWORD=dummytodos -d mysql:5.7
```

This command maps the Docker container's port `3306` to your machine's port `3306`.

### 9. Troubleshooting
If you are unable to connect, make sure that the port is correctly exposed to the host system. You can use the `docker container stop` command to stop the container and `docker container rm` to remove it, and then re-run the command with the correct port mapping.

### 10. Conclusion
By following these steps, you can run MySQL in a Docker container and connect to it from any MySQL client. This method eliminates the need to install MySQL natively on your machine, offering a clean, isolated environment for your databases.
