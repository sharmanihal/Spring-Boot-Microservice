# Circuit Breaker Fallback Mechanisms

When implementing a circuit breaker pattern in a microservices architecture, it is essential to define what happens when the circuit trips and requests are still coming in. The circuit breaker protects the system from calling a failing API or service repeatedly, but the downstream service still needs to respond to incoming requests. This is where fallback mechanisms come into play.

## The Role of Fallbacks
A fallback mechanism ensures that there is an alternate response or action when a service becomes unavailable. Instead of allowing the failure to propagate, a fallback provides a way to degrade gracefully.

## **1. Throw an Error (Last Resort)**
The simplest but least recommended fallback is to throw an error when the circuit is open.

- **Behavior**: The service immediately returns an error response when it cannot call the dependent service.
- **Pros**: Simple and easy to implement.
- **Cons**: Bad user experience; the calling system gets no usable data.

### Example
```
if (circuitBreaker.isOpen()) {
    throw new ServiceUnavailableException("Service is currently unavailable");
}
```

This approach is only acceptable when absolutely necessary, as it provides no meaningful fallback.

---

## **2. Provide a Default Fallback Response**
A better approach is to provide a hardcoded or static fallback response.

- **Behavior**: When the circuit breaker trips, the service sends a predefined, static response.
- **Pros**:
  - Better than an error as it ensures that a response is always returned.
  - Avoids complete failure of the calling service.
- **Cons**:
  - The static response may not be relevant or up-to-date.

### Example
```java
if (circuitBreaker.isOpen()) {
    return new MovieInfo("Fallback Movie", "Default description", "N/A");
}
```

While not ideal, it ensures that the system does not fail completely and provides some data.

---

## **3. Use Cached Responses (Recommended)**
The best fallback approach is to serve cached responses whenever possible.

- **Behavior**: Save previous successful responses in a cache and return those when the circuit is open.
- **Pros**:
  - Provides sensible and meaningful data to the calling service.
  - The end user may not even notice that the dependent service is down.
- **Cons**:
  - Cached data may become stale if the information changes frequently.

### Example
```java
if (circuitBreaker.isOpen()) {
    MovieInfo cachedMovie = cache.get(movieId);
    if (cachedMovie != null) {
        return cachedMovie;
    }
    return new MovieInfo("Fallback Movie", "Data unavailable", "N/A");
}
```

By returning cached data, the system ensures smooth operation without relying on the failing service.

## **Summary of Fallback Approaches**
| Fallback Approach              | Description                          | Recommended Use                |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **Throw an Error**             | Return an error when circuit trips   | Last resort, not recommended   |
| **Static Fallback Response**   | Return a hardcoded response          | Use when caching is unavailable|
| **Cached Responses**           | Use previously saved responses       | Best practice for fallbacks    |

## Conclusion
Implementing a fallback mechanism is a critical part of the circuit breaker pattern. Instead of simply breaking the circuit and returning an error, a service can:
1. Throw an error (last resort).
2. Return a static fallback response.
3. Use cached responses for a seamless experience (recommended).

The choice of fallback depends on the use case and the criticality of the data, but the goal is always to ensure graceful degradation and a better user experience.
