# Microservices Resilience and Fault Tolerance

## Introduction
In this section, we delve into the challenges of making microservices architectures resilient and fault-tolerant. The current setup demonstrates a lack of error handling or fault tolerance, making it vulnerable to service failures. While this might seem problematic, it provides an excellent starting point for introducing resilience and fault-tolerant mechanisms.

### Current Architecture Issues
- **Single Instance Vulnerability**: Each microservice runs as a single instance.
- **No Error Handling**: There are no `try-catch` blocks or mechanisms to handle failures.
- **Chained Dependencies**: Services like the Movie Catalog Service depend on multiple other services. If any service fails, the entire system fails.

### Problem Example
The Movie Catalog Service:
1. Calls one service to get a response.
2. Uses the response to call another service.
3. Combines the data and returns the response.

If either of the dependent services goes down, the Movie Catalog Service also goes down.

## Challenges in Microservices
Before introducing solutions, it is important to understand the potential issues:
1. **Instance Failure**: A single instance of a service going down can disrupt the entire system.
2. **Dependency Chain Failures**: A failure in one service can cascade to dependent services.

## Solution: Resilience through Redundancy
### Multiple Instances
A simple yet effective way to handle instance failure is to run multiple instances of a service. This ensures that even if one instance fails, others can take over.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Run Multiple Instances**:
   - Deploy multiple instances of a microservice.
   - Run instances on different machines or ports (avoid running on the same machine in production).

2. **Register with Eureka**:
   - Each instance registers with the Eureka server, which maintains a record of all available instances.
   - Example: If two instances of the Ratings Data Service are running, both register themselves with Eureka.

3. **Client-Side Load Balancing**:
   - Eureka uses Ribbon for client-side load balancing.
   - Ribbon ensures round-robin distribution of requests among available instances.
   - If one instance fails, Ribbon skips it and routes requests to the remaining instances.

### Benefits of Redundancy
- **Fault Tolerance**: Even if one instance goes down, others can handle the load.
- **Load Distribution**: Requests are distributed evenly across instances, improving scalability.
- **Automatic Recovery**: The system remains operational while the failed instance is fixed.
