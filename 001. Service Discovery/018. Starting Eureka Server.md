# Setting up a Eureka Server in Spring Boot

Eureka Server is a service registry provided by Netflix’s Eureka and is used for service discovery in microservices architectures. This guide explains the step-by-step process to set up and run a Eureka Server using Spring Boot.

## Steps to Set Up the Eureka Server

### 1. **Creating a Eureka Server**
- **No Dedicated Eureka Server Download**: You don’t download a Eureka Server directly. Instead, you create it as a Spring Boot application.
- **Use Spring Initializer**:
  - Go to [Spring Initializer](https://start.spring.io/).
  - Set the `Group` and `Artifact` (e.g., `org.example.discovery-server`).
  - Add the `Eureka Server` dependency.
  - Generate and download the Spring Boot project.

### 2. **Adding Dependencies**
Check the `pom.xml` file for the following dependency:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-server</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
If not included, add it manually.

### 3. **Enabling Eureka Server**
Add the `@EnableEurekaServer` annotation to the main application class to designate it as a Eureka Server:
```java
@SpringBootApplication
@EnableEurekaServer
public class DiscoveryServerApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(DiscoveryServerApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```

### 4. **Handling JAX-B Errors**

JAXB (Java Architecture for XML Binding) is a framework in Java that allows you to convert Java objects to XML and vice versa. It provides a convenient way to handle XML data by mapping it to Java classes, eliminating the need for manual parsing or building XML trees.
Key Features of JAXB

    Object-XML Mapping (OXM):
        Automatically binds Java classes to XML schemas.
        Converts XML data to Java objects (unmarshalling).
        Converts Java objects to XML data (marshalling).
        
- If using Java 11 or later, you may encounter JAX-B-related errors. JAX-B was removed from the JDK starting with Java 9.
- Add the following dependencies to handle these errors:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.xml.bind</groupId>
    <artifactId>jaxb-api</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.glassfish.jaxb</groupId>
    <artifactId>jaxb-runtime</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>javax.activation</groupId>
    <artifactId>activation</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

### 5. **Configuring Properties**
Add the following properties to `application.properties`:
```properties
# Set Eureka Server port (optional, default is 8761)
server.port=8761

# Prevent Eureka Server from registering with itself
eureka.client.register-with-eureka=false
eureka.client.fetch-registry=false
```

These properties ensure that the Eureka Server doesn’t try to act as a client by registering itself or fetching registries from other servers.

### 6. **Running the Eureka Server**
- Run the Spring Boot application. In the logs, you should see `Started Eureka Server`.
- Access the Eureka Server UI at `http://localhost:8761`.

## Understanding the Eureka Server UI
When you access the Eureka Server UI:
- **System Status**: Displays uptime and other metrics.
- **Registered Instances**: Initially, this section will be empty because no microservices have been registered yet.

---

## Additional Notes
1. **Eureka Client Dependency**:
   - Microservices that need to register with the Eureka Server must include the `Eureka Discovery Client` dependency.

2. **Multiple Eureka Servers**:
   - You can have multiple Eureka Server instances to ensure high availability.
   - By default, Eureka servers register with each other. Use the above properties to disable this behavior if it’s a standalone server.

3. **Default Port**:
   - The Eureka Server runs on port `8761` by default. This can be customized using the `server.port` property.

4. **Errors Without Configuration**:
   - If you don’t configure the `eureka.client.register-with-eureka` and `eureka.client.fetch-registry` properties, you might see errors in the logs. However, the server will still function.

By following these steps, you’ve successfully set up a standalone Eureka Server using Spring Boot.
