# Making the First Connection: Calling an API from a Microservice

## **Overview**
In this guide, we explain how to call the Movie Info API from the Movie Catalog Service. This is the point where we dive into microservices and learn how to:

1. Programmatically call one service from another.
2. Parse the response received from the API.
3. Use the parsed data to create an object that can be used in your application.

## **Key Concepts**

### **API Communication in Microservices**
- When calling a microservice (e.g., Movie Info Service) from another microservice (e.g., Movie Catalog Service):
  - You need to **write code** to make the HTTP call.
  - The response received is just **plain text** (e.g., JSON).
  - The text must be **deserialized (unmarshaled)** into an object (e.g., `Movie` or `Rating`).

### **Spring Boot's Solution: REST Clients**
- Spring Boot provides built-in tools to handle REST API calls.
- Two primary options are:
  1. **RestTemplate**
  2. **WebClient**

---

## **RestTemplate**

### What is RestTemplate?
- **RestTemplate** is a Spring-provided client for making RESTful API calls.
- It is widely used in existing Spring Boot projects.
- It provides a simple way to:
  1. Send HTTP requests (e.g., GET, POST).
  2. Deserialize the response into Java objects.

### Example Workflow:
1. **Call the API**:
   - Use `RestTemplate` to send an HTTP request to the Movie Info Service.
2. **Parse the Response**:
   - Convert the JSON response into a Java object using libraries like Jackson (Spring does this automatically if configured).

---

## **Deprecation of RestTemplate**
- **RestTemplate is being deprecated.**
  - Official documentation states that RestTemplate is planned for eventual deprecation.
  - New projects are encouraged to use **WebClient** instead.

---

## **WebClient**

### What is WebClient?
- **WebClient** is the modern, reactive alternative to RestTemplate.
- It is part of Spring WebFlux, which supports **reactive programming**.

### Reactive Programming in Java
- Reactive programming enables **asynchronous** and **non-blocking** communication.
- Example concepts:
  - Instead of synchronous step-by-step calls, you provide **callbacks**.
  - Functions or lambdas are called when data is ready (e.g., "fire-and-forget" style).
  
### Why Use WebClient?
- Handles **non-blocking IO** for better scalability.
- Built for modern, reactive systems.

## **Key Differences Between RestTemplate and WebClient**

| Feature               | RestTemplate                         | WebClient                             |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Nature**            | Synchronous                          | Asynchronous                          |
| **Ease of Use**       | Simple and beginner-friendly         | Requires knowledge of reactive programming |
| **Blocking**          | Blocks the thread                    | Non-blocking                          |
| **Usage Trend**       | Common in older codebases            | Preferred for modern microservices    |
| **Scalability**       | Limited by thread-per-request model  | More scalable due to non-blocking IO  |

---

## **Which One Should You Use?**
- **RestTemplate**:
  - Best for existing codebases where synchronous programming is the norm.
  - Easier to learn and implement.
- **WebClient**:
  - The future of Spring-based HTTP clients.
  - Ideal for building scalable, reactive microservices.

---

## **Next Steps**
1. Use **RestTemplate** to make API calls in the Movie Catalog Service.
2. Gradually familiarize yourself with **WebClient** for future-proofing your applications.
3. Learn about reactive programming to fully leverage WebClient.
