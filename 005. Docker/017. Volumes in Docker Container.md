### Docker Containers and Volumes: A Tutorial Summary

#### Introduction to Persistent Data with Containers

- **Objective**: The goal is to understand how Docker handles persistent data using **volumes**. 

#### Steps Taken in the Tutorial

1. **Stop and Remove Docker Containers**
   - Used `docker container ls` to check running containers and stop a container using `docker container stop <container_id>`.
   - Stopped containers are removed with `docker container prune`.
   - Re-ran MySQL and web applications in Docker containers.

2. **Working with Docker Logs**
   - Launched MySQL and web application containers using a custom network (`web-application-mysql-network`).
   - Used `docker container logs -f <container_id>` to follow the logs and observe the creation of a `todo` table in MySQL.

3. **Loss of Data in Containers**
   - After stopping and restarting containers, MySQL data persisted but was lost when containers were removed.
   - A new container from the same image would not have the previous data, illustrating the importance of **persistent storage**.

4. **The Role of Volumes in Data Persistence**
   - Introduced **volumes** to preserve data even when a container is deleted.
   - When starting a MySQL container, used the `--volume` flag to map MySQLâ€™s data directory (`/var/lib/mysql`) to a volume on the host machine (`mysql-database-volume`).

5. **Testing Volume Persistence**
   - Created a volume and confirmed data persisted after restarting or stopping the container, as the volume was mapped to a directory on the host.
   - Data continued to exist even after the MySQL container was removed and recreated.

6. **Creating and Using Volumes with Containers**
   - **Command to create a volume**: 
     ```bash
     docker run -d --name mysql --network web-application-mysql-network --volume mysql-database-volume:/var/lib/mysql mysql
     ```
   - Ensured that MySQL data persisted after multiple restarts, as long as the host machine and volume remained intact.

7. **Final Verification**
   - Stopped and removed the MySQL container, then started it again with the volume.
   - Verified that data was retained even after recreating the container, ensuring that **volumes** allow data to persist beyond the lifecycle of individual containers.

#### Conclusion

- **Volatile Containers**: Data within a container does not persist across container restarts or deletions.
- **Persistent Volumes**: To ensure data persistence, use Docker **volumes**. Volumes map container directories to the host filesystem, ensuring data is saved even if the container is stopped, restarted, or deleted.
