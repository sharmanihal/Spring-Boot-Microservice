## Circuit Breaker Concept in Microservices

### Introduction
In a microservices architecture, it is essential to have a mechanism that prevents cascading failures when a service is not functioning correctly. This is where the **circuit breaker pattern** comes in. Similar to an electrical circuit breaker, a microservice circuit breaker disconnects or "trips" to prevent further damage when failures occur. However, unlike an electrical circuit, microservices must handle requests even when the circuit is tripped.

### Why Use a Circuit Breaker?
When a microservice fails, the calling service cannot simply return an error or wait indefinitely for a response. A circuit breaker ensures that:
1. The calling service can gracefully handle failures.
2. Requests to a failing service are minimized to avoid further load.
3. The system can eventually recover when the failing service is back online.

### When Should the Circuit Break?
A circuit breaker must have smart logic to decide when to trip. This logic needs to accommodate various conditions such as intermittent failures and timeouts. Immediate failures after a single request timeout are not sufficient to trip the circuit; instead, the circuit breaker uses **parameters** to evaluate when to stop sending requests.

## Key Parameters of a Circuit Breaker
The following parameters determine how and when a circuit breaker trips:

### 1. **Last N Requests to Consider**
- When a failure occurs, the circuit breaker evaluates the last N requests (e.g., 5 requests) to determine the failure rate.
- It does not act on a single failure because isolated issues can occur.
- Example: Look at the last 5 requests to decide if the circuit should break.

### 2. **Failure Threshold**
- This defines the number (or percentage) of failed requests within the last N requests that triggers the circuit to break.
- Example: If 3 out of the last 5 requests fail, trip the circuit.

### 3. **Timeout Duration**
- A timeout duration specifies the maximum time to wait for a response before marking a request as failed.
- Example: If a request takes more than 2 seconds, consider it a failure.

### 4. **Sleep Window**
- After the circuit is tripped, the circuit breaker waits for a predefined duration before trying to send requests again.
- This prevents continuous retries to a failing service, which can worsen the situation.
- Example: Wait for 10 seconds before sending a request to the failing service to check if it has recovered.

## Example Configuration
Consider the following circuit breaker configuration:
- **Last N Requests to Consider:** 5
- **Failure Threshold:** 3
- **Timeout Duration:** 2 seconds
- **Sleep Window:** 10 seconds

### Request Scenario:
| Request | Response Time | Status          |
|---------|---------------|-----------------|
| 1       | 100 ms        | Success         |
| 2       | 3 seconds     | Timeout (Fail)  |
| 3       | 300 ms        | Success         |
| 4       | 3 seconds     | Timeout (Fail)  |
| 5       | 4 seconds     | Timeout (Fail)  |

- **Analysis:**
  - The circuit breaker evaluates the last 5 requests.
  - Out of the 5 requests, 3 have failed (timeout).
  - Since the failure threshold (3) has been met, the circuit breaker trips.

- **Outcome:**
  - The circuit breaker stops sending further requests for the next 10 seconds (sleep window).

## How to Recover from a Tripped Circuit?
When the circuit breaker trips, the service does not immediately send new requests. Instead:
1. The **sleep window** duration elapses.
2. The circuit breaker sends a test request to the previously failing microservice to check if it has recovered.
3. If the test request succeeds, the circuit closes, and normal requests resume.
4. If the test request fails, the circuit remains open, and the sleep window resets.

## Determining the Right Parameters
Configuring the circuit breaker parameters is critical and often requires trial and error. Consider the following factors:
1. **Request Frequency:** How frequently are requests sent to the service?
2. **Thread Pool Size:** How many concurrent requests can the application handle?
3. **Failure Patterns:** Observe historical patterns of failures and response times to determine appropriate thresholds.
