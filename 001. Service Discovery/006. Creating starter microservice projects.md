# Creating a Spring Boot Application

## Overview
This guide explains how to create a Spring Boot application using the web interface provided by [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/). You will need to repeat the steps three times to create the following microservices:

1. **Movie Catalog Service**
2. **Movie Info Service**
3. **Ratings Data Service**

## Steps to Create a Spring Boot Application

### Step 1: Access the Spring Initializer
1. Open a web browser and navigate to [start.spring.io](https://start.spring.io/).
2. This page provides an interface to define the configuration of your Spring Boot project.

### Step 2: Enter Project Details
1. **Group**: Enter a group name, typically in reverse domain format (e.g., `com.example`).
2. **Artifact**: Provide a unique name for the application. For example:
   - `movie-catalog-service`
   - `movie-info-service`
   - `ratings-data-service`
3. **Dependencies**: Add the necessary dependency by clicking the "Add Dependencies" button and selecting **Spring Web**. This will enable you to build REST APIs.
4. **Java Version**: Select the Java version compatible with your system. (Recommended: Java 21, if available.)

### Step 3: Generate the Project
1. Click on the "Generate" button.
2. A ZIP file containing the project will be downloaded to your computer.

### Step 4: Import the Project into Your IDE
1. Extract the ZIP file to a folder on your machine.
2. Open your preferred IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Spring Tool Suite, Eclipse).
3. Import the project as a Maven project:
   - **IntelliJ IDEA**: File > Open > Select the extracted folder.
   - **Spring Tool Suite/Eclipse**: File > Import > Maven > Existing Maven Projects.

### Step 5: Repeat for All Microservices
Follow the same steps to create the remaining two microservices, changing the **Artifact** name for each:
- `movie-info-service`
- `ratings-data-service`

## Best Practices
1. **Keep Dependencies Minimal**: Only include the required dependencies to keep the project lightweight.
2. **Version Compatibility**: Ensure the selected Java version matches the one installed on your system.
3. **Naming Conventions**: Use consistent and descriptive names for your projects.

## Next Steps
After creating the basic Spring Boot projects:
1. Configure the services by adding controllers, services, and data models as needed.
2. Build and run each application to verify that they start successfully.
3. Proceed to implement the logic specific to each microservice.

By following these steps, you will have the foundational setup for your Spring Boot microservices.
