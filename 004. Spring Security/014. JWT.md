# Understanding JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for Authorization

## Introduction

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is a popular method for user authorization in web applications. It has gained significant traction, especially in the context of microservices, due to the modern development practices in building web applications. In this document, we will explore:

- What JWT is
- How it is used for securing web applications
- A comparison between JWT and session tokens

## What is JWT?

JWT is an open industry standard defined in [RFC 7519](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519) that outlines how to structure and use JWT for secure information exchange ("claims") between two parties. While it can be used for various purposes, it is predominantly used for managing authorization.

### Pronunciation
JWT is commonly pronounced as "jot," although opinions vary. For simplicity, we will refer to it as "JWT" in this document.

## Why Authorization Mechanisms Exist

### Stateless Nature of HTTP
HTTP is a stateless protocol, meaning every interaction must contain all the information required for that interaction. Servers do not retain any state between requests. For example:

1. A client requests page P1 by saying, "I am User A, and I want page P1."
2. The server responds with page P1.
3. For a subsequent request for page P2, the client must again state, "I am User A, and I want page P2."

This statelessness creates challenges when server responses depend on user-specific information, necessitating mechanisms to maintain "state" across multiple interactions.

### Common Authorization Mechanisms

1. **Session Tokens**
   - The server creates a session and associates it with a session ID.
   - This session ID is given to the client (usually stored in a cookie).
   - Subsequent requests include the session ID, which the server uses to look up the session.

2. **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**
   - Unlike session tokens, JWT contains all the user information within the token itself, eliminating the need for server-side state storage.

## Understanding Session Tokens

Session tokens work like a "support ticket" in customer service:

- **Analogy:**
  - A customer receives a support ticket with details saved in the system.
  - The ticket number references the saved details.
  - During the next interaction, the ticket number retrieves the customer's details.

- **Implementation:**
  - Session IDs are usually stored in cookies for easy retrieval.
  - The server maintains a session store (e.g., Redis) to keep track of sessions.

- **Challenges:**
  - Requires server-side state storage.
  - In distributed systems or microservices, maintaining session consistency can be challenging.
  - Solutions include shared session caches or sticky sessions, both of which have scalability or reliability drawbacks.

## JWT: The Alternative Model

JWT addresses the limitations of session tokens by embedding all the necessary information within the token itself. Here's how it works:

1. **Information Storage:**
   - When a client authenticates, the server creates a JSON object containing user information.
   - This JSON object is signed to ensure its integrity and then returned to the client as a JWT.

2. **Subsequent Requests:**
   - The client includes the JWT in each request.
   - The server validates the JWT signature and extracts the user information without needing server-side state storage.

3. **Security:**
   - JWTs are signed, preventing tampering. The server can trust the contents if the signature is valid.

### Key Differences Between Session Tokens and JWT

| Feature                | Session Tokens                   | JSON Web Tokens (JWT)         |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| Storage                | Server-side state storage        | Self-contained on the client  |
| Scalability            | Requires shared state or sticky sessions | Stateless and highly scalable |
| Security Verification  | Session ID lookup                | Signature validation          |
| Data Transmission      | References session state         | Contains session data         |

## JWT Usage in Practice

### JWT Structure
A JWT consists of three parts:
1. **Header:** Metadata about the token (e.g., type and signing algorithm).
2. **Payload:** The actual data ("claims") being transmitted.
3. **Signature:** Ensures the token's integrity.

### Example JWT
A JWT might look like:
```plaintext
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.SflKxwRJSMeKKF2QT4fwpMeJf36POk6yJV_adQssw5c
```

### Parsing and Creating JWTs
- Decoding the token reveals the JSON payload.
- Signature validation ensures the token has not been tampered with.

### JWT vs. Session Tokens in Authorization
JWTs are ideal for:
- Scalable, stateless systems.
- Microservices with distributed architecture.

However, they may not always replace session tokens. Both mechanisms have their own use cases and trade-offs.

## Conclusion
JWT offers a modern, scalable alternative to traditional session-based authorization. By embedding user information directly within the token and eliminating server-side state storage, JWT simplifies authentication in distributed and microservice architectures. However, careful implementation is required to ensure security and efficiency.
