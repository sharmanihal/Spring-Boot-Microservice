## Making Image Layers More Cacheable

### Current Setup
- We currently have an image for the JDK, on top of which we copy the Fat JAR.
- The Fat JAR is created by the Spring Boot Maven plugin and is about 16.8 MB.
- This JAR contains:
  1. Maven dependencies (all the JARs needed to run the project).
  2. Class files and property files required to run the application.

### Understanding Change Frequency
- Dependencies change occasionally but not as often as code.
- Typically, dependencies stabilize after initial project setup.
- Goal: Reflect this stability in our Docker image layers.

### Desired Layer Structure
1. JDK (base image).
2. Dependencies (less frequently changing).
3. Classes and properties (frequently changing).

By structuring layers this way, the dependency layer can be cached.

## Splitting the Fat JAR

### Using Maven Dependency Plugin
To achieve the desired layer structure, we need to split the Fat JAR into its components.

- Plugin: Maven Dependency Plugin
- Goal: `unpack`
- Outcome: Splits the JAR into individual components.

```xml
<plugin>
	<groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
	<artifactId>maven-dependency-plugin</artifactId>
	<version>3.8.1</version>
	<executions>
		<execution>
			<id>unpack</id>
			<phase>package</phase>
			<goals>
				<goal>unpack</goal>
			</goals>
		</execution>
	</executions>
	<configuration>
		<artifactItems>
			<artifactItem>
				<groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
				<artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
				<version>${project.version}</version>
			</artifactItem>
		</artifactItems>
		<!-- other configurations here -->
	</configuration>
</plugin>
```

### Steps:
1. Add the Maven Dependency Plugin to `pom.xml` above the Docker file Maven plugin.
2. Run:
   ```
   mvn clean package
   ```
3. Configuration:
   - Path includes artifact ID, group ID, and version of the JAR.
   - Unpack the JAR.

### Result:
- The JAR is unpacked into a `target/dependency` folder containing:
  1. `BOOT-INF/libs`: All required JARs.
  2. `classes`: Application classes.
  3. `META-INF`: Metadata.

## Updating the Dockerfile

### Steps:
1. Copy `lib` folder first into the Docker image.
2. Copy `classes` folder.
3. Copy `META-INF` files.

### Dockerfile Example:
```
FROM openjdk:8-jdk-alpine
ARG DEPENDENCY=target/dependency
COPY ${DEPENDENCY}/BOOT-INF/lib /app/lib
COPY ${DEPENDENCY}/META-INF /app/META-INF
COPY ${DEPENDENCY}/BOOT-INF/classes /app
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-cp","app:app/lib/*","com.in28minutes.rest.webservices.restfulwebservices.RestfulWebServicesApplication"]
```

## Building and Testing the Image

### Build Command:
```bash
docker build -t nihal/hello-world-rest-api:dockerfile1 .
```

### Verifying Cache Efficiency:
- Modify `HelloWorldController` to include "Hello World v5".
- Run:
  ```bash
  mvn clean package -DskipTests
  docker build -t in28min/hello-world-rest-api:dockerfile1 .
  ```
- Observe caching:
  - Dependencies are pulled from cache unless `pom.xml` changes.
  - Only changed layers are rebuilt and pushed.

---

## Benefits of Cache Optimization
- Faster builds due to fewer rebuilds.
- Reduced data transfer when pushing to registries like Docker Hub.
  - Base images and cached layers are reused.
  - Only changes are pushed.
