# Building Microservices with Spring Cloud

## Introduction
This section introduces a practical approach to building microservices using **Spring Cloud**. We’ll start from scratch, focusing on creating a minimalistic and modular setup. The example will demonstrate a real-world use case inspired by Goodreads, tailored for movies instead of books.

## Why Spring Cloud?
Spring Cloud offers a robust framework for developing microservices, providing essential features such as:
- Service discovery
- Load balancing
- Resilience and fault tolerance

We’ll adhere to a philosophy of **using only what’s required**, avoiding unnecessary dependencies to keep our project lightweight and focused.

## Prerequisites
- **Java**
- **Spring Boot**: Familiarity with Spring Boot is assumed. If you’re new to it, consider brushing up on basic concepts before proceeding.

## High-Level Architecture
Our microservices will follow a simple orchestration model:
- **Service 1**: Provides data related to movies.
- **Service 2**: Provides additional data related to users.
- **Service 3**: Acts as an aggregator, consolidating data from Service 1 and Service 2 and returning it as a single response.

Here’s a high-level diagram of the architecture:
```
Service 1 (Movies)  --->  
                        \       Service 3 (Aggregator) ---> Response
Service 2 (Users)   --->  
```

## Example Use Case: Movie Catalog API
We’ll build a simple **Movie Catalog API** that:
- Accepts a `userID` via an API call.
- Returns a list of movies the user has watched, along with their ratings and descriptions.

### Frontend Integration
This API can be consumed by a JavaScript-based frontend application to display a user’s movie catalog in the following format:
- **Movie Name**
- **Description**
- **Rating**

### API Endpoint Example
**GET** `/api/user/{userID}`
- **Response**: A JSON array containing movie details, such as:
```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "movies": [
    {
      "id": "001",
      "name": "Inception",
      "description": "A mind-bending thriller",
      "rating": 5
    },
    {
      "id": "002",
      "name": "The Matrix",
      "description": "A sci-fi classic",
      "rating": 4.5
    }
  ]
}
```

## Simplified Approach
- **Hardcoding Data**: To focus on microservices and their communication, we’ll hardcode data instead of using a database.
- **Read-Only API**: We’ll implement a read-only API to keep the scope manageable.

## Next Steps
1. Set up a Spring Boot project for each microservice.
2. Add minimal dependencies for essential Spring Cloud features.
3. Implement service communication and orchestration using REST APIs.
4. Test the flow to ensure proper integration between the microservices.
