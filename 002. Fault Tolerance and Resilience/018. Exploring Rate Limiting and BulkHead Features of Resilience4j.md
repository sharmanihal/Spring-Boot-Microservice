# Rate Limiting and Bulkhead with Resilience4j

## Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is a mechanism to control the rate at which an API can be called. It restricts the number of API calls within a specified time period. For example:

```properties
resilience4j.ratelimiter.instances.movie-catalog-api.limitRefreshPeriod=10s
resilience4j.ratelimiter.instances.movie-catalog-api.limitForPeriod=2
```

In this configuration:
- A maximum of **2 requests** are allowed in **10 seconds** for the `movie-catalog-api`.

To implement rate limiting in your application:

```java
@RateLimiter(name = "movie-catalog-api", fallbackMethod = "getCatalogFallback")
public Response getCatalog() {
    // API logic here
}
```

If the rate limit is exceeded, the specified `getCatalogFallback` method will be invoked.

## Bulkhead
Bulkhead is another resilience mechanism used to control the number of concurrent calls to an API. It helps prevent resource exhaustion by limiting simultaneous requests.

```properties
resilience4j.bulkhead.instances.movie-catalog-api.maxConcurrentCalls=10
```

In this configuration:
- A maximum of **10 concurrent calls** are allowed for the `movie-catalog-api`.

To implement bulkhead in your application:

```java
@Bulkhead(name = "movie-catalog-api", fallbackMethod = "getCatalogFallback")
public Response getCatalog() {
    // API logic here
}
```

When the number of concurrent calls exceeds the limit, the `getCatalogFallback` method will be invoked.

---

By combining **Rate Limiter** and **Bulkhead**, you can ensure both the rate and concurrency limits of your APIs are effectively managed.
