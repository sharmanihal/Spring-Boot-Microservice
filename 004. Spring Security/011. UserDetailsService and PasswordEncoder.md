### How Authentication Works:

1. **Authentication Filter**:
   - Captures the user's credentials (username and password) from the HTTP request.
   - Delegates the authentication process to the **`AuthenticationManager`**.

2. **Authentication Manager**:
   - Acts as the central orchestrator for authentication.
   - Delegates the task to an **`AuthenticationProvider`** to handle the actual logic.

3. **Authentication Provider**:
   - The **provider** uses the **`UserDetailsService`** to fetch user details based on the provided username.
   - Validates the password using the configured **`PasswordEncoder`**.

4. **`UserDetailsService`**:
   - In your case, **`InMemoryUserDetailsManager`** is being used, which stores user credentials in memory (not recommended for production, only for testing or small applications).
   - Contains methods like `createUser()` to add users and manage their credentials.

5. **`PasswordEncoder`**:
   - The password encoder ensures that the password provided during login is matched against the stored password.
   - Here, you're using **`NoOpPasswordEncoder`**, which does **no encoding at all**. This is insecure and should never be used in a real-world application. It's only for demonstration or testing purposes.

### Your Configuration Code Explained:

```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig {

    // Providing a custom UserDetailsManager bean
    @Bean
    public UserDetailsService userDetailsManager() {
        UserDetailsManager userDetails = new InMemoryUserDetailsManager();

        // Creating users and adding them to the UserDetailsManager
        var user1 = User.builder()
                .username("abc")
                .password("hello") // Password stored as plain text (due to NoOpPasswordEncoder)
                .authorities("read") // Assigning authority/role
                .build();
        var user2 = User.builder()
                .username("xyz")
                .password("hello") // Same as above
                .authorities("write")
                .build();

        userDetails.createUser(user1);
        userDetails.createUser(user2);
        return userDetails; // Returning the custom UserDetailsManager
    }

    // Providing a custom PasswordEncoder bean
    @Bean
    public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
        return NoOpPasswordEncoder.getInstance(); // Plain-text passwords
    }
}
```

### Key Details:

1. **Custom `UserDetailsManager`**:
   - You've implemented a **custom `UserDetailsManager` bean**, which tells Spring Security where and how to retrieve user details (username, password, authorities).
   - Users `abc` and `xyz` are added in memory with plain-text passwords (`hello`).

2. **Custom `PasswordEncoder`**:
   - You've provided a **`PasswordEncoder`** bean (`NoOpPasswordEncoder`) that does not hash passwords. This encoder allows you to store and compare plain-text passwords.
   - **âš  Important**: This is **not secure** for production use.

### Authentication Flow in Your Application:

1. **Login Request**: 
   - A user sends their username and password in the login request.

2. **Authentication Filter**:
   - Extracts the credentials and passes them to the `AuthenticationManager`.

3. **Authentication Manager**:
   - Calls the `AuthenticationProvider` to validate the user.

4. **Authentication Provider**:
   - Uses the **`UserDetailsManager`** to fetch the user record (e.g., `abc` or `xyz`).
   - Compares the provided password (`hello`) with the stored password (`hello`) using the **`PasswordEncoder`**.

5. **Result**:
   - If the credentials match, the user is authenticated, and their details are stored in the **SecurityContext**.
   - Otherwise, the authentication fails.

### Improvements for Production:

1. **Use a Secure Password Encoder**:
   - Replace `NoOpPasswordEncoder` with a secure encoder like `BCryptPasswordEncoder`:
     ```java
     @Bean
     public PasswordEncoder passwordEncoder() {
         return new BCryptPasswordEncoder();
     }
     ```
   - When creating users, encode passwords like this:
     ```java
     var user1 = User.builder()
             .username("abc")
             .password(passwordEncoder().encode("hello")) // Encode the password
             .authorities("read")
             .build();
     ```

2. **Use a Persistent `UserDetailsService`**:
   - Replace `InMemoryUserDetailsManager` with a database-backed implementation to store user credentials persistently.

3. **Enable HTTPS**:
   - Always secure your application with HTTPS to encrypt data in transit.

### Conclusion:

This setup demonstrates how to configure a custom **`UserDetailsManager`** and **`PasswordEncoder`** in Spring Security, ensuring that you have full control over authentication. While it works for basic examples and testing, the suggested improvements (secure password encoding, database-backed user details) are crucial for real-world applications.
