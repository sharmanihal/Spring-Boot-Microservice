# Docker Container Commands

In this document, we cover various Docker container commands that help manage and control containers. These include commands for starting, pausing, unpausing, stopping, inspecting, pruning, and setting restart policies.

## 1. Docker Container Run
- `docker run -p 5000:5000 <repository>:<tag>`
  - This command creates a container from a specific image.
  - You can run the container in detached mode using `-d` to get the container ID.

## 2. Pause and Unpause Containers
- `docker container pause <container_id>`
  - Pauses a running container, stopping its processes.
  - You can use either the full container ID or the first 4 digits.
  
- `docker container unpause <container_id>`
  - Resumes a paused container.

## 3. Docker Container Logs
- `docker logs -f <container_id>`
  - This command follows and shows the logs of a running container.
  - Example usage shows that if a container is paused, logs will not show responses.

## 4. Inspecting Containers
- `docker container inspect <container_id>`
  - Provides detailed information about a container, including metadata, platform details, port bindings, and volumes.

## 5. Docker Container Prune
- `docker container prune`
  - Removes all stopped containers. Use with caution to avoid deleting necessary data.

- Example usage:
  ```bash
  docker container ls -a    # List all containers (including stopped ones)
  docker container prune     # Remove all stopped containers
  ```

## 6. Stopping Containers
- `docker container stop <container_id>`
  - Gracefully stops a running container. This allows the container to complete ongoing processes (e.g., closing connections, saving data).
  
  - Stopping a container sends the `SIGTERM` signal, allowing it to shut down gracefully.
  - Example: Logs show that the container shuts down services (e.g., ExecutorService, EntityManagerFactory).

## 7. Killing Containers
- `docker container kill <container_id>`
  - Forcefully stops a running container without allowing it to finish processes. Sends the `SIGKILL` signal, immediately stopping the container.

## 8. Restart Policies
- `docker run -p 5000:5000 --restart=always <image_name>`
  - Sets a container's restart policy. The `always` policy will automatically restart the container if the Docker daemon is restarted, ensuring continuous uptime for important services.
  
  - Other policies include `no` (default) and `unless-stopped`.

## 9. Restarting Docker Desktop
- Restarting Docker Desktop will restart the Docker daemon. Containers with a `--restart=always` policy will be automatically restarted.
  
## 10. Cleaning Up Containers
- `docker container stop <container_id>`
- `docker container prune`
  - To clean up all stopped containers, ensure no containers are running, stop them if necessary, and then run `docker container prune`.

## Summary of Commands:
- `docker container run` – Start a container
- `docker container pause` – Pause a container
- `docker container unpause` – Unpause a container
- `docker container logs -f` – Follow the logs of a container
- `docker container inspect` – Get detailed information about a container
- `docker container prune` – Remove stopped containers
- `docker container stop` – Gracefully stop a container
- `docker container kill` – Forcefully stop a container
- `docker run --restart=always` – Set a restart policy for a container

## Conclusion
These Docker container commands are essential for managing containers in different states. They allow you to control the lifecycle of containers, inspect them, and configure them for automatic restarts.
