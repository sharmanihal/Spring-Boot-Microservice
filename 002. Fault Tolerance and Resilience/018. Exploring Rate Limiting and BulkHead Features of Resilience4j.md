# Rate Limiting and Bulkhead with Resilience4j

## Rate Limiting
Rate limiting is a mechanism to control the rate at which an API can be called. It restricts the number of API calls within a specified time period. For example:

```properties
resilience4j.ratelimiter.instances.movie-catalog-api.limitRefreshPeriod=10s
resilience4j.ratelimiter.instances.movie-catalog-api.limitForPeriod=2
```

In this configuration:
- A maximum of **2 requests** are allowed in **10 seconds** for the `movie-catalog-api`.

To implement rate limiting in your application:

```java
@RateLimiter(name = "movie-catalog-api", fallbackMethod = "getCatalogFallback")
public Response getCatalog() {
    // API logic here
}
```

If the rate limit is exceeded, the specified `getCatalogFallback` method will be invoked.

# The Bulkhead Pattern in Microservices

The **Bulkhead Pattern** is a design strategy for handling system outages and ensuring fault tolerance in microservices architectures. It prevents failures in one part of a system from affecting other parts, similar to how ship compartments isolate damage to keep the ship afloat.

## Origin of the Bulkhead Concept
The term comes from shipbuilding. Ships are designed with watertight compartments so that even if one compartment is breached and flooded, the rest of the ship remains unaffected. This isolation of compartments prevents cascading failures and protects the ship's overall integrity.

## Application in Microservices
In microservices, the bulkhead pattern can be applied to isolate resources, such as threads, for different services or components. This ensures that issues in one service do not propagate to others, maintaining the overall systemâ€™s stability.

### Problem Addressed
Imagine a scenario where:
- Service **B** is slow, consuming all available threads.
- Service **A** also relies on the same thread pool, but because **B** is consuming all resources, **A** becomes unresponsive.

This situation is akin to a breached ship compartment flooding the entire vessel. The bulkhead pattern mitigates this by allocating separate resources for **A** and **B**, ensuring that failures in one service do not affect the other.

### Solution: Watertight Compartments for Threads
To implement the bulkhead pattern:
1. Allocate separate thread pools for different services or components.
2. Configure maximum thread limits and queue sizes for each pool.

This isolates resource consumption, ensuring that a slowdown or failure in one service does not cascade to others.


## Bulkhead
Bulkhead is another resilience mechanism used to control the number of concurrent calls to an API. It helps prevent resource exhaustion by limiting simultaneous requests.

```properties
resilience4j.bulkhead.instances.movie-catalog-api.maxConcurrentCalls=10
```

In this configuration:
- A maximum of **10 concurrent calls** are allowed for the `movie-catalog-api`.

To implement bulkhead in your application:

```java
@Bulkhead(name = "movie-catalog-api", fallbackMethod = "getCatalogFallback")
public Response getCatalog() {
    // API logic here
}
```

When the number of concurrent calls exceeds the limit, the `getCatalogFallback` method will be invoked.

By combining **Rate Limiter** and **Bulkhead**, you can ensure both the rate and concurrency limits of your APIs are effectively managed.
