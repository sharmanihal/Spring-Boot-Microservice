### **Creating a Custom Network for Docker Containers**

1. **Introduction**:
   - How to create a custom Docker network and connect containers to it, allowing them to communicate with each other.

2. **Creating the Custom Network**:
   - Command to create a custom Docker network:
     ```
     docker network create web-application-mysql-network
     ```
   - This command creates a bridge network named `web-application-mysql-network`.

3. **Listing Running Containers**:
   - To see the containers currently running:
     ```
     docker container ls
     ```
   - The MySQL container currently running needs to be stopped before proceeding:
     ```
     docker container stop mysql
     ```

4. **Launching the MySQL Container in the Custom Network**:
   - To relaunch the MySQL container in the newly created network, use the following command:
     ```
     docker run --detach --env MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=dummypassword --env MYSQL_USER=todos-user --env MYSQL_PASSWORD=dummytodos --env MYSQL_DATABASE=todos --name mysql --publish 3307:3306 --network=web-application-mysql-network  mysql:5.7
     ```
   - If a container with the same name already exists, remove it using:
     ```
     docker rm mysql
     ```
   - After removing the container, the MySQL container will start in the background connected to the custom network.

5. **Launching the Web Application in the Custom Network**:
   - The web application does not need to be linked to MySQL since both containers are in the same network. The web application can communicate with MySQL directly.
   - Use the following command to launch the web application:
     ```
      docker run -p 8080:8080 --network=web-application-mysql-network  -e RDS_HOSTNAME=mysql -e RDS_PORT=3306 <app-image-name>

     ```

6. **Verifying Communication**:
   - The MySQL and web application containers, once added to the custom network, can communicate with each other.
   - The web application starts up, connects to MySQL, initializes a connection pool, and creates a database table successfully.

7. **Testing the Application**:
   - Once the server is running, you can add a new "to-do" entry, which will be saved in the database.
   - However, any previous data may be lost after restarting the container, which brings up the need for **volumes** to persist data.

8. **Inspecting the Custom Network**:
   - To inspect the custom network and verify which containers are connected, use:
     ```
     docker inspect web-application-mysql-network
     ```
   - This will show that both the MySQL and web application containers are part of the custom bridge network.

9. **Conclusion**:
   - Containers in a custom bridge network can communicate directly without the need for linking.
   - The tutorial explains the process of setting up a network, launching containers in it, and ensuring they can interact smoothly.
   - In the next step, the tutorial will cover how to retain data in MySQL containers using volumes.
