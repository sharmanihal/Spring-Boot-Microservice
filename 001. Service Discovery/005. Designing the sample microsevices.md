# Building Microservices with Spring Boot

## Overview
This guide details the development of three microservices using Spring Boot, following a naive-to-advanced progression. Each microservice is focused on a specific responsibility and communicates with others to form a complete Movie Catalog application. 

### Microservices Overview

1. **Movie Catalog Service**:
   - **Responsibility**: Provides the payload of movies and their details for a given user.
   - **Input**: User ID.
   - **Output**: A list of movies watched by the user, with details like description and rating.

2. **Movie Info Service**:
   - **Responsibility**: Provides details about a specific movie.
   - **Input**: Movie ID.
   - **Output**: Movie details such as name and description.

3. **Ratings Data Service**:
   - **Responsibility**: Stores and retrieves ratings for movies by a user.
   - **Input**: User ID.
   - **Output**: Movie IDs with associated ratings.

## Development Steps

### Step 1: Create Three Spring Boot Projects
Each microservice will be a separate Spring Boot application with its own codebase and configuration.

### Step 2: Build the Movie Catalog Service API
- Initially, serve a hardcoded list of movies for a given user.
- This service acts as the orchestrator by calling the other two microservices to retrieve and combine data.
- The service flow:
  1. Receive a User ID.
  2. Call the Ratings Data Service to fetch movie IDs and ratings.
  3. For each movie ID, call the Movie Info Service to fetch movie details.
  4. Combine the results and return the response.

### Step 3: Build the Movie Info Service API
- **Responsibility**: Provide movie details based on a Movie ID.
- **Setup**: Assume it fetches data from an internal database or an external service.
- **Output**: Returns details like movie name and description.

### Step 4: Build the Ratings Data Service API
- **Responsibility**: Retrieve user-specific ratings data.
- **Input**: User ID.
- **Output**: A list of Movie IDs with their ratings.
- This service focuses solely on ratings data and delegates fetching movie details to the Movie Info Service.

### Step 5: Integrate the Services
- Initially, implement integration in a naive way (direct REST API calls).
- Gradually introduce improvements like **Service Discovery** for better scalability and maintainability.

## Key Concepts

1. **Orchestration**:
   - The Movie Catalog Service acts as the orchestrator, aggregating data from other services.

2. **Separation of Concerns**:
   - Each microservice handles its specific functionality independently.

3. **Naive Integration**:
   - Start with direct REST API calls between services.

4. **Service Discovery**:
   - A future enhancement to eliminate hardcoded service endpoints and improve scalability.

## Example Flow

1. User ID is provided to the Movie Catalog Service.
2. The Movie Catalog Service:
   - Calls the Ratings Data Service to retrieve movie IDs and ratings.
   - Calls the Movie Info Service for details about each movie.
3. Combines the results and returns them to the client.

## Final Thoughts
- The naive approach provides a foundational understanding.
- Future steps will replace basic integrations with advanced mechanisms, such as service discovery, for better efficiency and scalability.
