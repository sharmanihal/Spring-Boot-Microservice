#### 1. **Stopping a Running Application in Docker**
   - To stop a running Docker container, you can press `Control + C`. This will kill the container and stop the application.

#### 2. **Running Containers in Detached Mode**
   - By default, when you run a Docker container, the terminal is tied to the lifecycle of the container, meaning it shows logs and stops when you exit.
   - To run a container in the background (detached mode), use the `-d` flag. This allows the container to keep running even if you exit the terminal.

   ```bash
   docker run -d <image_name>
   ```

   - Once the container is started in detached mode, you won't see the logs directly in the terminal.

#### 3. **Viewing Container Logs**
   - To see the logs of a running container, use the `docker logs` command followed by the container ID or the first few characters of the ID:
   
   ```bash
   docker logs <container_id>
   ```

   - To follow the logs continuously (like tailing), use the `-f` flag:
   
   ```bash
   docker logs -f <container_id>
   ```

   - You can stop following the logs by pressing `Control + C`.

#### 4. **Checking Running Containers**
   - To see a list of all running containers, use:
   
   ```bash
   docker container ls
   ```

   - To see all containers, including stopped ones, use:
   
   ```bash
   docker container ls -a
   ```

   - This shows the status of each container (e.g., up or exited).

#### 5. **Running Multiple Containers from the Same Image**
   - You can run multiple containers from the same Docker image by specifying different port mappings. For example, if one container is running on port `5000`, you can run another container on port `5001`.

   ```bash
   docker run -p 5001:5000 -d <image_name>
   docker run -p 5000:5000 -d <image_name>
   ```

   - Now, you have two instances of the application running on different ports: one on port `5000` and another on port `5001`.
   - You might be wondering how come we are able to run the conatiner on same container port 5000, well Docker containers have isolated networking environments, allowing them to run services on the same internal port (e.g., port 5000) without conflict. Host ports are mapped to container ports using the -p flag, ensuring each container is accessible on different host ports (e.g., 5000, 5001). This isolation prevents port clashes between containers.

#### 6. **Accessing Running Containers**
   - You can access the application running in the containers by using the port you mapped to the container, e.g., `http://localhost:5001` for the second container.

#### 7. **Viewing Docker Images**
   - To see the images present on your machine, use:
   
   ```bash
   docker images
   ```

   - This will list all the local images you have downloaded or built. These are the images available on your local machine.

#### 8. **Stopping Running Containers**
   - To stop a running container, use the `docker container stop` command followed by the container ID (or a unique part of the ID):
   
   ```bash
   docker container stop <container_id>
   ```

   - For example, if the container ID starts with `38155`, you can stop it with:
   
   ```bash
   docker container stop 38155
   ```

   - After stopping the containers, they will be marked as "exited" when you check their status.

#### 9. **Cleaning Up: Viewing Stopped Containers**
   - After stopping containers, to view all containers (including stopped ones), run:
   
   ```bash
   docker container ls -a
   ```

   - This command shows all containers, whether they are running or stopped, and their statuses (e.g., "exited").

### Summary of Key Docker Commands:
- `docker run -d <image_name>` – Run a container in detached mode.
- `docker logs <container_id>` – View logs of a container.
- `docker logs -f <container_id>` – Follow the logs of a container.
- `docker container ls` – List all running containers.
- `docker container ls -a` – List all containers (including stopped ones).
- `docker images` – List all images available on your machine.
- `docker container stop <container_id>` – Stop a running container.

These commands help you manage Docker containers and images effectively, allowing you to run, monitor, and stop applications within containers.
