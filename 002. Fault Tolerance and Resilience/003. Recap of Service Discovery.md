# Microservices Workshop: Level 1 Recap

## The Story So Far

In Level 1 of this workshop, we focused on building a foundational understanding of microservices and their communication mechanisms. Here's a summary of what we accomplished:

### Project Overview

We created an application inspired by platforms like Goodreads or IMDb, allowing users to:
- Save the movies they have watched.
- Rate these movies.
- Retrieve movie information along with their ratings.

When a user makes a request using their user ID, the application:
1. Returns the list of movies they have watched.
2. Provides details about each movie, including the title, description, and the userâ€™s rating.

### Microservices Architecture

To achieve this functionality, we developed three microservices:

1. **Movie Info Service**:
   - Accepts a movie ID as input.
   - Returns movie details such as the title and description.
   - Example: Movie ID `100` returns information like "Movie Title" and "Movie Description."

2. **Ratings Data Service**:
   - Stores user ratings for movies.
   - Contains a hardcoded list of movie IDs and their corresponding ratings (no database connectivity).
   - Example: Movie ID `1` has a rating of `3`, and Movie ID `2` has a rating of `5`.

3. **Movie Catalog Service**:
   - Acts as the entry point for the application.
   - Coordinates with the other two services to:
     - Fetch the list of movies and ratings from the **Ratings Data Service**.
     - Retrieve detailed movie information for each movie ID from the **Movie Info Service**.
     - Combine this data into a consolidated response and send it back to the user.
   - Example: Returns a response with the movie ID, title, description, and user rating.

### Service Discovery with Eureka

To enable communication between the services, we implemented service discovery using **Eureka**:
- **Discovery Server (Eureka Server)**:
  - Centralized service registry where microservices register themselves.
  - Runs on port `8761` (configured in `application.properties` with `server.port=8761`).
  - Provides a dashboard to monitor registered services.

- **Service Registration**:
  - Each microservice registers itself with the Eureka Server.
  - This allows microservices to discover each other dynamically without hardcoding URLs.

- **Orchestration by Movie Catalog Service**:
  - The **Movie Catalog Service** uses Eureka to:
    - Query the **Ratings Data Service** for user ratings.
    - Fetch movie details from the **Movie Info Service**.
    - Return a consolidated response to the user.

### Technical Implementation

- **Starting the Services**:
  - Each microservice was run individually by executing the `main` method in their respective `Application` classes.
  - The Eureka Server was started on port `8761`.

- **Eureka Dashboard**:
  - Accessible at `http://localhost:8761`.
  - Displays information about registered services, their status, and other metadata.

- **Service Communication**:
  - The **Movie Catalog Service** orchestrates communication using Eureka to dynamically discover and interact with the other two services.

### Key Concepts Covered

- Setting up multiple microservices using Spring Boot.
- Implementing service discovery with Eureka Server.
- Understanding how microservices dynamically discover and communicate with each other.
- Using a central registry to manage service interactions and avoid hardcoding URLs.
