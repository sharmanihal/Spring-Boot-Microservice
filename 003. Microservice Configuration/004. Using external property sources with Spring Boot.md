# Spring Boot Configuration: Overriding Properties Without Repacking the JAR

In this tutorial, we explore how to manage and override properties in a Spring Boot application without modifying the original JAR file. This ensures flexibility and avoids tedious processes like unpacking and repacking the JAR.

## Scenario
You have a Spring Boot application with its `application.properties` file packaged inside a JAR. The JAR is built using Maven (`mvn install` or `mvn package`) and deployed. If you need to change a property later, how can you do so without modifying the JAR?

### Running the Application
Run the application using the command:

```bash
java -jar spring-boot-config-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

The application will pick up properties from the `application.properties` file inside the JAR.

## Overriding Properties

### 1. External `application.properties`
You can create an external `application.properties` file in the same directory as the JAR. Spring Boot will detect this file and override the properties from the file inside the JAR.

#### Example:
- Inside JAR: `application.properties`
  ```properties
  my.greeting=Hello World
  ```
- External `application.properties`:
  ```properties
  my.greeting=Hello World from external property file
  ```

Run the application:

```bash
java -jar spring-boot-config-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Result: The application will use the value `Hello World from external property file`.

### 2. Command-Line Arguments
You can also override properties using command-line arguments when starting the application.

#### Example:
```bash
java -jar spring-boot-config-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --my.greeting="Hello World from command-line argument"
```

Result: The application will use the value `Hello World from command-line argument`.

### 3. System Properties
Spring Boot can read system properties directly. This is useful for environments like Heroku, where configurations like database credentials are passed as system properties.

#### Example:
```bash
java -Dmy.greeting="Hello World from system property" -jar spring-boot-config-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

Result: The application will use the value `Hello World from system property`.

## Property Source Priority
Spring Boot applies properties in the following order of precedence (highest to lowest):

1. Command-line arguments
2. System properties
3. External `application.properties` file
4. `application.properties` inside the JAR

## Accessing Properties in Code
To access properties in your code, use the `@Value` annotation:

```java
@Value("${my.greeting}")
private String greeting;
```

This approach is consistent regardless of the property source.

## Summary
By leveraging external property files, command-line arguments, and system properties, you can configure your Spring Boot application dynamically without modifying the original JAR. This flexibility is particularly useful for deploying the same JAR across multiple environments with different configurations.
