# Why Use Servlet Filters?

Basically, any Spring web application is just one servlet: Spring’s good old DispatcherServlet, that redirects incoming HTTP requests (e.g., from a browser) to your `@Controllers` or `@RestControllers`.

The thing is: There is no security hardcoded into that DispatcherServlet, and you also very likely don’t want to fumble around with a raw HTTP Basic Auth header in your `@Controllers`. Optimally, the authentication and authorization should be done before a request hits your `@Controllers`.

Luckily, there’s a way to do exactly this in the Java web world: you can put filters in front of servlets, which means you could think about writing a `SecurityFilter` and configure it in your Tomcat (servlet container/application server) to filter every incoming HTTP request before it hits your servlet.

## A Naive `SecurityFilter`

A `SecurityFilter` has roughly four tasks, and a naive and overly-simplified implementation could look like this:

```java
import javax.servlet.*;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpFilter;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
import java.io.IOException;

public class SecurityServletFilter extends HttpFilter {

    @Override
    protected void doFilter(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response, FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException {

        UsernamePasswordToken token = extractUsernameAndPasswordFrom(request);  // (1)

        if (notAuthenticated(token)) {  // (2)
            // either no or wrong username/password
            // unfortunately the HTTP status code is called "unauthorized", instead of "unauthenticated"
            response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_UNAUTHORIZED); // HTTP 401.
            return;
        }

        if (notAuthorized(token, request)) { // (3)
            // you are logged in, but don't have the proper rights
            response.setStatus(HttpServletResponse.SC_FORBIDDEN); // HTTP 403
            return;
        }

        // allow the HttpRequest to go to Spring's DispatcherServlet
        // and @RestControllers/@Controllers.
        chain.doFilter(request, response); // (4)
    }

    private UsernamePasswordToken extractUsernameAndPasswordFrom(HttpServletRequest request) {
        // Either try and read in a Basic Auth HTTP Header, which comes in the form of user:password
        // Or try and find form login request parameters or POST bodies, i.e. "username=me" & "password="myPass"
        return checkVariousLoginOptions(request);
    }

    private boolean notAuthenticated(UsernamePasswordToken token) {
        // compare the token with what you have in your database...or in-memory...or in LDAP...
        return false;
    }

    private boolean notAuthorized(UsernamePasswordToken token, HttpServletRequest request) {
       // check if currently authenticated user has the permission/role to access this request's /URI
       // e.g. /admin needs a ROLE_ADMIN , /callcenter needs ROLE_CALLCENTER, etc.
       return false;
    }
}
```

1. First, the filter needs to extract a username/password from the request. It could be via a Basic Auth HTTP Header, or form fields, or a cookie, etc.

2. Then the filter needs to validate that username/password combination against something, like a database.

3. The filter needs to check, after successful authentication, that the user is authorized to access the requested URI.

4. If the request survives all these checks, then the filter can let the request go through to your DispatcherServlet, i.e., your `@Controllers`.

## FilterChains

**Reality Check**: While the above code works and compiles, it would sooner or later lead to one monster filter with a ton of code for various authentication and authorization mechanisms.

In the real world, however, you would split this one filter up into multiple filters that you then chain together.

For example, an incoming HTTP request would…

- First, go through a `LoginMethodFilter`…
- Then, go through an `AuthenticationFilter`…
- Then, go through an `AuthorizationFilter`…
- Finally, hit your servlet.

This concept is called a `FilterChain`, and the last method call in your filter above is actually delegating to that very chain:

```java
chain.doFilter(request, response);
```

With such a filter (chain), you can basically handle every authentication or authorization problem there is in your application without needing to change your actual application implementation (think: your `@RestControllers` / `@Controllers`).

Armed with that knowledge, let’s find out how Spring Security makes use of this filter magic.
