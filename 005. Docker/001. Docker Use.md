### **Scenario Overview**  
You’re a star developer in a project with tight deadlines. The team needs to quickly deploy an application, and you decide to use **Docker** for its efficiency in deployment and environment management.  

---

### **Step-by-Step Process**  

1. **Collaborate with the Operations Team**:  
   Work with your team to understand the deployment requirements.

2. **Verify Docker Installation**:  
   Open the terminal or command prompt and check if Docker is installed by typing:  
   ```bash
   docker --version
   ```  
   - The output will show the installed Docker version.  
   - Ensure the version is greater than **18** for better compatibility.  

3. **Deploy the Application**:  
   Run the following command to deploy the application:  
   ```bash
   docker run in28min/todo-rest-api-h2:1.0.0.RELEASE
   ```  
   - Press **Enter**, and Docker will handle the deployment.

### **Understanding Docker Concepts**  

When you execute the command `docker run in28min/todo-rest-api-h2:1.0.0.RELEASE`, you are using several Docker concepts. Let’s break it down:  

---

#### 1. **Docker Registry**  
   - **What is it?**  
     A place where Docker images are stored. Think of it as a library of application templates.  
   - **Examples**:  
     - **Public Registry**: Docker Hub (`hub.docker.com`) is open to everyone.  
     - **Private Registry**: Companies can set up private repositories for security.  

---

#### 2. **Docker Repository**  
   - **What is it?**  
     A collection of related Docker images for a specific application.  
   - **Example**:  
     In `in28min/todo-rest-api-h2`, `in28min` is the repository name.  

---

#### 3. **Docker Image**  
   - **What is it?**  
     A pre-built package that contains everything needed to run the application, like:  
     - Code  
     - Dependencies  
     - Runtime configurations  
   - **Key Point**:  
     An image is static—it doesn’t do anything until it’s run as a container.

---

#### 4. **Docker Container**  
   - **What is it?**  
     A running instance of a Docker image.  
   - **Why is it useful?**  
     - It’s isolated from other containers and the host system.  
     - Lightweight and quick to start.  
   - **Example**:  
     Running the `docker run` command creates a container from the image.  

---

#### 5. **Tag**  
   - **What is it?**  
     The specific version of the image.  
   - **Example**:  
     In `1.0.0.RELEASE`, the tag indicates the version of the application image.  

---

#### 6. **Container Port vs. Host Port**  
   - **By default**:  
     Docker runs containers on internal container ports.  
   - **Exposing Ports**:  
     If you want to access the application from your system, you need to map the container port to a host port.  
   - **Command Example**:  
     ```bash
     docker run -p 5000:5000 in28min/todo-rest-api-h2:1.0.0.RELEASE
     docker run -p HOST_PORT:CONTAINER_PORT
     ```  
     - This maps container port **5000** to host port **5000**.

### **What Happens When You Run a Docker Command?**  

1. **Command Execution**:  
   ```bash
   docker run in28min/todo-rest-api-h2:1.0.0.RELEASE
   ```  

2. **Steps Behind the Scenes**:  
   1. Docker checks if the image (`in28min/todo-rest-api-h2:1.0.0.RELEASE`) is available **locally**.  
   2. If the image isn’t found, Docker **downloads it** from the Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub).  
   3. Docker **creates a container** from the image.  
   4. The container is **run**, and the application starts.
