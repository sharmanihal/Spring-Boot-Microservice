**CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)** is a web security vulnerability that allows an attacker to trick a user into performing actions they did not intend to on a web application where they are authenticated.

### How CSRF Works:
1. **Victim Authentication**: The victim logs into a trusted website (e.g., their bank website) and their browser stores the session (via cookies or tokens).
2. **Malicious Request**: The attacker tricks the victim into visiting a malicious website or clicking a crafted link that makes a request to the trusted website.
3. **Exploiting Trust**: The victim's browser automatically includes their authentication credentials (e.g., cookies) with the request to the trusted website.
4. **Unintended Action**: The trusted website processes the malicious request as if it was made by the victim.

### Example:
#### Scenario:
Suppose a banking website allows transferring money using the following HTTP POST request:

```
POST /transfer HTTP/1.1
Host: bank.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

amount=1000&recipient=12345678
```

If a user is logged into the bank and their session cookie is stored in the browser, the request will be processed successfully.

#### CSRF Attack:
1. The attacker creates a malicious website with a form like this:
```html
<form action="https://bank.com/transfer" method="POST">
  <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="1000">
  <input type="hidden" name="recipient" value="12345678">
</form>
<script>
  document.forms[0].submit();
</script>
```

2. The victim visits the malicious website while logged into the bank.
3. The malicious website automatically submits the form, and the bank processes the request using the victim's authenticated session.

### Result:
The victim unknowingly transfers money to the attacker.
