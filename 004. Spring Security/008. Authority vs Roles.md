# Introduction to Spring Security

Spring Security is the de facto framework for securing Spring applications. As part of the larger Spring ecosystem, which is widely used to build various Java applications, learning Spring Security is essential for Java developers. This framework handles two critical aspects of application security:

1. **Authentication**: Identifying who the user is.
2. **Authorization**: Determining what the user is allowed to do.

## Why Learn Spring Security?

- Most Spring applications rely on Spring Security for securing application workflows.
- Understanding Spring Security ensures proper configuration and implementation of security mechanisms in applications.

## Authentication

Authentication is the process of determining who the user is. Various methods can be used for authentication:

- **Credentials**: Username and password (most common starting point).
- **Hashed Fingerprints**
- **Certificates**
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**

Authentication is the first step, where the application verifies the userâ€™s identity.

## Authorization

Authorization comes after authentication and involves deciding what actions the authenticated user is permitted to perform. 

- **Authorization Decision**: Based on rules configured in the application.
- **No Security Rules**: Some applications may not require authentication or authorization.
- **Roles and Authorities**:
  - **Authority**: Represents actions a user can perform (e.g., read, write, delete).
  - **Role**: Represents who the user is (e.g., admin, manager, user).

### Difference Between Role and Authority

| **Authority**            | **Role**               |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Represents an action      | Represents an identity|
| Example: `READ`, `WRITE`  | Example: `ADMIN`, `USER` |

Both roles and authorities are conceptually different but technically share the same underlying contract in Spring Security, known as the `GrantedAuthority` interface.

## Ways to Define Authentication and Authorization Rules

Spring Security provides several mechanisms to define authentication and authorization:

### Authentication Methods

1. **HTTP Basic Authentication**
2. **Certificates**
3. **Complex Flows** (e.g., JWT, OAuth 2.0)

### Authorization Methods

- **Web Applications**:
  - HTTP Filters
  - Aspects
- **Non-Web Applications**:
  - Aspects (only option as HTTP Filters are web-specific)

## Summary

Spring Security is a powerful and essential framework for securing Spring applications. While the concepts of authentication and authorization seem simple, their implementation involves a deep understanding of various options and configurations. 

This guide aims to prepare you to:

- Understand the theory behind authentication and authorization.
- Learn how to use Spring Security effectively through hands-on coding.
