This detailed walkthrough introduces building a basic Spring Boot application, specifically a **Movie Catalog Service**. Here's a summary and explanation of the steps and concepts covered:

---

### 1. **Initial Spring Boot Setup**
   - **Main Class**:
     - Contains the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation, indicating it's a Spring Boot application.
     - Includes the `main` method to launch the application.
   - **Dependencies**:
     - Spring Boot's web starter dependency brings in an embedded **Tomcat server**, enabling it to listen for HTTP requests (default on port `8080`).

   **Outcome**: The application starts but does nothing yet since no mappings or controllers are defined, leading to the default **White Label Error Page**.

---

### 2. **Creating a REST Controller**
   - **New Java Class**:
     - A class named `MovieCatalogResource` is created to handle API requests.
   - **`@RestController`**:
     - Marks the class as a Spring MVC controller where each method maps to a RESTful endpoint.
     - Spring Boot automatically scans and manages the controller as part of the application context.

---

### 3. **Defining the Endpoint**
   - **Method Definition**:
     - `public List<CatalogItem> getCatalog(String userId)`
       - Accepts a `userId` as a path parameter.
       - Returns a hardcoded list of `CatalogItem` objects.
   - **Path Parameter Handling**:
     - `@RequestMapping` at the class level: Maps requests starting with `/catalog` to this controller.
     - `@GetMapping` or `@RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET)` at the method level: Specifies `/catalog/{userId}`.
     - `@PathVariable`: Extracts the `userId` from the URL and passes it to the method.

   **Example**:
   ```java
   @RequestMapping("/catalog")
   public class MovieCatalogResource {
       @GetMapping("/{userId}")
       public List<CatalogItem> getCatalog(@PathVariable("userId") String userId) {
           return Collections.singletonList(
               new CatalogItem("Transformers", "Test description", 4)
           );
       }
   }
   ```

---

### 4. **Model Definition**
   - **`CatalogItem` Class**:
     - Represents the data structure returned by the API.
     - Includes fields like `name`, `description`, and `rating`.
     - Includes:
       - Getters and setters for each field.
       - A parameterized constructor to easily create objects.
   **Example**:
   ```java
   public class CatalogItem {
       private String name;
       private String description;
       private int rating;

       // Constructor
       public CatalogItem(String name, String description, int rating) {
           this.name = name;
           this.description = description;
           this.rating = rating;
       }

       // Getters and setters
       public String getName() { return name; }
       public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }
       public String getDescription() { return description; }
       public void setDescription(String description) { this.description = description; }
       public int getRating() { return rating; }
       public void setRating(int rating) { this.rating = rating; }
   }
   ```

---

### 5. **Testing the API**
   - Start the application.
   - Access the endpoint using a browser or a tool like Postman.
     - Example URL: `http://localhost:8080/catalog/foo`.
   - Output:
     ```json
     [
         {
             "name": "Transformers",
             "description": "Test description",
             "rating": 4
         }
     ]
     ```

---

### Key Concepts:
- **Microservices**: This small, independent Spring Boot application acts as a microservice with its own logic and API.
- **Dummy Data**: Hardcoding is used for initial development and testing.
- **Path Variable**: Dynamic parts of the URL are extracted and passed to the method as arguments.
- **RESTful API**: The endpoint follows REST principles to handle client requests.

---

### What's Next?
To make this a complete microservice, you can:
1. Connect to a database to fetch real data.
2. Add external service calls for inter-service communication.
3. Implement unit tests for the API (using `JUnit` or `Mockito`).
4. Secure the service with Spring Security.
5. Deploy it to a cloud platform like AWS or Azure.

Would you like further clarification on any of these steps or assistance with advancing this service?
