# Microservices Communication and Service Discovery

## Overview
In this session, we explored how microservices communicate with each other using service discovery, load balancing, and fault tolerance. We walked through different scenarios of service registration and discovered how the system behaves when a service goes down.

## Service Discovery
- We ran two instances of a microservice discovery server and observed multiple instances being returned.
- The client-side load balancing took place, which meant that the client could send requests to any of the available services.
  
### Fault Tolerance
- **Scenario 1: Service Down**
  - If a service goes down, the discovery server still provides a reference to it.
  - When the client asks for the service, the discovery server provides the address.
  - However, when the client tries to reach the service, it could fail if the service is down.

- **Solution: Heartbeats**
  - Eureka clients send regular heartbeat signals to the Eureka server to confirm they are still alive.
  - If a service doesn't send a heartbeat in a predefined period, Eureka marks it as unavailable and removes it from the registry.
  
### Discovery Server Down
- **Scenario 2: Discovery Server Goes Down**
  - If the discovery server goes down, Eureka clients will use cached information to attempt communication with other services.
  - This cached information will allow the client to continue functioning without hitting the error if the discovery server is temporarily unavailable.
  
  - **Note:** If the service is also down, the cached information will not be valid, but the system still tries to make the best use of available data.

## Handling Errors and Fallbacks
- In case of errors, a circuit breaker mechanism like **Hystrix** can help manage and prevent failures from propagating across the system.

## Communication Recap
1. We started by setting up multiple microservices communicating with each other using RestTemplate and hardcoded URLs.
2. We discovered that hardcoding URLs was not ideal, so we introduced **Service Discovery** using Eureka Server, where microservices register themselves.
3. We added the `@LoadBalanced` annotation to the `RestTemplate` to enable client-side load balancing and eliminate the need for hardcoded URLs.
4. We also learned about the differences between **client-side** and **server-side** load balancing.
