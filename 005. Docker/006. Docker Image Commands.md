# Docker Image Commands and Concepts

## 1. Docker Images Overview
- Use `docker images` to list available images on your local machine.
- Displays repository, tag, and image ID for each image.

## 2. Tagging Images
- You can tag an image with multiple tags. For example:
  ```bash
  docker tag <image_id> <repository_name>:<new_tag>
  ```
- Tags can help to reference different versions of the same image. Example: Adding the "latest" tag to an image.
- Running `docker images` will show the same image with multiple tags.

## 3. `latest` Tag
- The `latest` tag does not necessarily refer to the most recent version, it is just a tag like any other (e.g., `1.0.0.RELEASE`).
- The `latest` tag is not automatically updated; it is something you manually assign to a specific version.

## 4. Pulling Images
- Use `docker pull <image_name>` to pull an image from a registry (e.g., Docker Hub).
  - Example: `docker pull mysql`
- If no tag is specified, the `latest` tag is pulled by default.
- `docker pull` only downloads the image. To run it, you need to use `docker run`.

## 5. `docker run` vs `docker pull`
- `docker run` checks if the image is available locally. If not, it pulls the image from the registry and starts a container.

## 6. Official Images
- Docker offers "official" images that are curated and maintained by Docker's team.
- These images meet certain standards and are typically recommended for use.
- You can search for official images using `docker search <image_name>`.
  - Example: `docker search mysql` shows the official MySQL image.

## 7. Viewing Image History
- Use `docker image history <image_id>` to see the steps involved in building an image.
  - Displays layer sizes, commands, and the history of changes made to the image.

## 8. Inspecting Images
- Use `docker image inspect <image_id>` to get detailed information about an image, such as:
  - Tags
  - Digest
  - Created date
  - Containers created from the image
  - Exposed ports
  - Environment variables
  - Entrypoint and commands run when the container is launched

## 9. Removing Images
- Use `docker image remove <image_id>` to remove an image from your local machine.
  - Note: This does not delete the image from the Docker registry; it only removes it locally.

## Summary of Key Commands
- `docker images` - List local images.
- `docker tag <image_id> <repository_name>:<new_tag>` - Tag an image with a new tag.
- `docker pull <image_name>` - Download an image from a registry.
- `docker run <image_name>` - Run a container from an image.
- `docker search <image_name>` - Search for an image in Docker Hub.
- `docker image history <image_id>` - View the history of an image.
- `docker image inspect <image_id>` - Get detailed information about an image.
- `docker image remove <image_id>` - Remove an image from your local machine.

## Final Thoughts
- Official images are generally recommended for standard software like MySQL, Java, etc.
- Understanding image tags, history, and inspection is crucial for managing Docker images efficiently.
