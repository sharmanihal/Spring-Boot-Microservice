Sure thing! Let's dive into what a Servlet Filter is in a simple and easy-to-understand way:

### What is a Servlet Filter?

A **Servlet Filter** is a Java object that can be used to intercept and modify both the requests going into a web application and the responses coming out of it. Think of it as a gatekeeper or a checkpoint that can inspect, modify, or even block these HTTP requests and responses.

### Why Use Servlet Filters?

Servlet Filters are useful for:
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Tracking the request and response data.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: Checking if a user is logged in or has permission to access a resource.
- **Data Compression**: Compressing or decompressing request and response data.
- **Input Validation**: Checking and validating incoming request parameters.
- **Request and Response Transformation**: Modifying the request before it reaches the servlet or the response before it goes back to the client.

### How Do Servlet Filters Work?

Here's a step-by-step explanation of how servlet filters work:

1. **Request Interception**: When a client sends a request to a web server, the request first goes through the filter chain (a series of filters).
2. **Filter Processing**: Each filter in the chain can inspect and modify the request or decide whether to pass it on to the next filter or the target servlet.
3. **Response Interception**: After the servlet processes the request and generates a response, the response also goes back through the filter chain.
4. **Filter Processing**: Each filter in the chain can inspect and modify the response before it is sent back to the client.

### Example of a Simple Servlet Filter

Here's a basic example of a filter that logs the request URL:

```java
import java.io.IOException;
import javax.servlet.Filter;
import javax.servlet.FilterChain;
import javax.servlet.FilterConfig;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.ServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.ServletResponse;
import javax.servlet.annotation.WebFilter;

@WebFilter("/example/*")
public class LoggingFilter implements Filter {

    public void init(FilterConfig config) throws ServletException {
        // Filter initialization code (if needed)
    }

    public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
            throws IOException, ServletException {

        // Log the request URL
        System.out.println("Request received for URL: " + request.getRemoteAddr());

        // Pass the request along the filter chain
        chain.doFilter(request, response);
    }

    public void destroy() {
        // Cleanup code (if needed)
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Annotation `@WebFilter`**: This annotation maps the filter to specific URL patterns. In this case, it filters all requests to URLs that start with `/example`.
2. **`init` Method**: Called when the filter is first created. You can use it for initialization tasks.
3. **`doFilter` Method**: This is where the filter's main logic goes. It logs the request URL and then passes the request and response along the filter chain using `chain.doFilter(request, response)`.
4. **`destroy` Method**: Called when the filter is about to be destroyed. You can use it for cleanup tasks.

When a servlet filter calls `chain.doFilter(request, response)`, it passes the request and response along to the next element in the filter chain. The filter chain is a sequence of filters defined in the web application.

### Filter Chain Sequence
1. **Order Defined in `web.xml` or Annotations**: The sequence of filters is typically defined either in the `web.xml` file or by the order in which `@WebFilter` annotations are processed. Filters are executed in the order they are defined.

2. **Next Filter**: If there are more filters in the chain, the `doFilter` method of the next filter will be executed.

3. **Servlet or Resource**: If there are no more filters, the request will be passed to the target servlet or the requested resource (like a JSP or static file).

Here's a visual representation of how a filter chain works:

```plaintext
Client Request -> Filter 1 -> Filter 2 -> ... -> Filter N -> Servlet/Resource -> Response
```

### Example:
If you have three filters: `AuthFilter`, `LoggingFilter`, and `CompressionFilter`, and they are defined in that order, the request will pass through each filter in sequence:

1. **AuthFilter**: Authenticates the user.
2. **LoggingFilter**: Logs the request details.
3. **CompressionFilter**: Compresses the request data.

After passing through all filters, the request reaches the target servlet or resource.

```java
public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response, FilterChain chain)
        throws IOException, ServletException {
    // Pre-processing logic
    chain.doFilter(request, response); // Passes control to the next filter or servlet
    // Post-processing logic
}
```

In summary, `chain.doFilter(request, response)` passes the request to the next filter in the chain or to the target servlet/resource if there are no more filters.
