#### Key Components of Docker Architecture:

1. **Docker Client**:
   - This is the interface where you run your Docker commands.
   - When you type a command in the Docker Client, it sends the command to the **Docker Daemon** for execution.

2. **Docker Daemon (or Docker Engine)**:
   - The Docker Daemon is responsible for:
     - **Managing containers**: Creating, running, and stopping containers.
     - **Managing local images**: Storing the images that you use to create containers.
     - **Pulling images from the image registry**: If an image is not present locally, the Docker Daemon will pull it from an online repository.
     - **Pushing images to the image registry**: If you’ve created a new image, the Docker Daemon can push it to an image repository so others can use it.

#### Docker Architecture Overview:

- Docker operates on a **client-server architecture**, where:
  - The **Docker Client** is where you interact with Docker (e.g., running commands).
  - The **Docker Daemon** processes those commands, handles containers, images, and communicates with repositories.

#### How Docker Works in Practice:

1. **Running Containers**:
   - When you run a container (e.g., `docker run -p 5000:5000`), the Docker Client sends the command to the Docker Daemon.
   - If the image needed for the container is already available locally, Docker Daemon uses it to create and run the container without re-downloading the image.

2. **Pulling New Images**:
   - If the image you want to use isn’t available locally, Docker Daemon pulls it from an image registry (like Docker Hub) and runs it.
   - For example, if you run a command with a tag that doesn’t exist locally (e.g., `docker run 0.0.1-SNAPSHOT`), Docker Daemon fetches the image from the registry.

#### Creating and Managing Images:

- While we’ve been using pre-built images in this course, Docker allows us to create our own images.
- The **Docker Daemon** can also help in **building new images** from instructions (Dockerfiles) and **pushing them to an image registry** so others can use them.

#### Summary of Docker’s Responsibilities:
- **Docker Client**: Sends commands to Docker Daemon.
- **Docker Daemon**:
  - Manages local containers and images.
  - Pulls images from repositories if not found locally.
  - Builds new images and pushes them to registries.

#### Conclusion:
In this step, we explored how Docker’s components interact:
- The **Docker Client** allows you to interact with Docker through commands.
- The **Docker Daemon** manages containers and images locally and can interact with image repositories to fetch or upload images.

This foundational understanding of Docker’s architecture will help you as you move forward with Docker usage and containerization.
