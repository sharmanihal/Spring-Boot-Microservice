# WebClient vs RestTemplate in Spring Boot

## Introduction
Spring Boot provides two primary ways to make REST API calls: `RestTemplate` and `WebClient`. While `RestTemplate` is widely used and simpler to implement, it is on its way to being deprecated. The `WebClient` offers a more modern, reactive approach to making API calls and is the recommended solution for future projects.

This guide compares the two approaches and introduces `WebClient`, with practical examples for understanding its usage and how it differs from `RestTemplate`.

## RestTemplate Overview
`RestTemplate` is the traditional way of making REST API calls in Spring Boot. It provides:
- Synchronous operations.
- Simplicity and ease of implementation.

**Example:** Making an API call with `RestTemplate`:
```java
RestTemplate restTemplate = new RestTemplate();
Movie movie = restTemplate.getForObject("http://movie-info-service/movies/{movieId}", Movie.class, movieId);
```
- A single line is sufficient to make the call and convert the response into an object instance.

However, `RestTemplate` is synchronous, meaning it blocks execution until the API call completes.

## WebClient Overview
`WebClient` is part of the reactive programming model in Spring WebFlux. It allows asynchronous, non-blocking API calls. Key characteristics include:
- Reactive and non-blocking behavior.
- Requires `Spring WebFlux` dependency.
- More verbose compared to `RestTemplate`.

### Setting Up WebClient
1. Add the `Spring WebFlux` dependency in `pom.xml`:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-webflux</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

2. Define a `WebClient.Builder` bean:
```java
@Bean
public WebClient.Builder webClientBuilder() {
    return WebClient.builder();
}
```

### Using WebClient
Here is an example of making an API call with `WebClient`:
```java
@Autowired
private WebClient.Builder webClientBuilder;

public Movie fetchMovie(String movieId) {
    WebClient client = webClientBuilder.build();

    Movie movie = client.get()
        .uri("http://movie-info-service/movies/{movieId}", movieId)
        .retrieve()
        .bodyToMono(Movie.class)
        .block();

    return movie;
}
```

### Key Steps Explained:
1. **Create WebClient Instance:**
   ```java
   WebClient client = webClientBuilder.build();
   ```
   Use the `WebClient.Builder` to create a reusable client instance.

2. **Specify HTTP Method:**
   ```java
   client.get();
   ```
   Define the HTTP method (e.g., `get()`, `post()`).

3. **Set the URI:**
   ```java
   .uri("http://movie-info-service/movies/{movieId}", movieId);
   ```
   Specify the target endpoint.

4. **Retrieve Response:**
   ```java
   .retrieve()
   ```
   Fetch the response data.

5. **Convert to Object:**
   ```java
   .bodyToMono(Movie.class)
   ```
   Convert the response body into a `Mono<Movie>`, representing an asynchronous result.

6. **Blocking for Result:**
   ```java
   .block();
   ```
   Block execution until the result is available (synchronous behavior).

## Synchronous vs Asynchronous Behavior
### Synchronous (RestTemplate):
- Blocks the current thread until the API call completes.
- Simpler for sequential workflows.

### Asynchronous (WebClient):
- Does not block the current thread.
- Uses reactive types like `Mono` or `Flux` to handle results asynchronously.

**Example of Asynchronous Processing:**
```java
client.get()
    .uri("http://movie-info-service/movies/{movieId}", movieId)
    .retrieve()
    .bodyToMono(Movie.class)
    .subscribe(movie -> {
        // Process movie once it is available.
    });
```
- The `subscribe()` method defines a callback that is executed when the data is ready.

---

## Blocking vs Non-Blocking
- Blocking with `.block()` in WebClient makes it synchronous, similar to `RestTemplate`.
- Non-blocking programming with `WebClient` is achieved by returning `Mono` or `Flux` directly.

**Returning a Mono:**
```java
public Mono<Movie> fetchMovieAsync(String movieId) {
    return client.get()
        .uri("http://movie-info-service/movies/{movieId}", movieId)
        .retrieve()
        .bodyToMono(Movie.class);
}
```
The method returns a `Mono<Movie>` instead of blocking to get the result.

## Why Use WebClient?
- Future-proof: `RestTemplate` is being deprecated.
- Reactive programming enables better scalability and performance for modern applications.
- Suitable for asynchronous and event-driven systems.

## Conclusion
While `RestTemplate` is simpler and sufficient for many use cases today, transitioning to `WebClient` prepares your application for the future of reactive programming. For this workshop, `RestTemplate` remains the primary focus, but understanding `WebClient` equips you for upcoming trends in the Spring ecosystem.
