# Docker Commands Overview

In this section, we explored several useful Docker commands that help us manage containers, monitor Docker events, and observe resource usage.

## Docker Events
- **Purpose:** The `docker events` command is used to monitor the events occurring in the Docker environment, such as container start, stop, network disconnection, and volume unmounting.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```bash
  docker events
  ```
  - Run `docker container ls` to view the active containers.
  - Then, use `docker events` to observe events occurring with your containers.

## Docker Top
- **Purpose:** The `docker top` command shows the top processes running within a specific container.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```bash
  docker top <container_id>
  ```
  - Find the container ID using `docker container ls`.
  - This command will display the processes running inside the specified container.

## Docker Stats
- **Purpose:** The `docker stats` command provides real-time statistics on the running containers, such as CPU usage, memory usage, and network I/O.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```bash
  docker stats
  ```
  - This command will display metrics like memory usage, CPU usage, and limits for each container.

## Docker System DF
- **Purpose:** The `docker system df` command shows the disk usage by Docker images, containers, and volumes.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```bash
  docker system df
  ```
  - It displays detailed information about images, containers, and volumes managed by the Docker daemon.

## Setting Memory and CPU Limits
- **Purpose:** You can limit the resources (memory and CPU) for containers using the `-m` (memory) and `--cpu-quota` (CPU) flags.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```bash
  docker run -m 512m --cpu-quota 5000 <image_name>
  ```
  - **Memory Limit (`-m`):** Limits the memory allocation for the container. Example: `-m 512m` limits it to 512 MB.
  - **CPU Quota (`--cpu-quota`):** Defines the CPU resources. Example: `--cpu-quota 5000` assigns 5% of the CPU.

## Observing Logs
- **Purpose:** The `docker container logs` command allows you to view the logs of a specific container.
- **Example Usage:**
  ```bash
  docker container logs -f <container_id>
  ```

## Summary of Commands
1. **`docker events`:** Monitors Docker events happening in the environment.
2. **`docker top`:** Shows the processes running inside a container.
3. **`docker stats`:** Displays resource statistics (CPU, memory) for running containers.
4. **`docker system df`:** Provides disk usage information for images, containers, and volumes.
5. **Resource Limiting:** Use `-m` to limit memory and `--cpu-quota` to limit CPU usage for containers.
