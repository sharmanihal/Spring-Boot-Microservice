# Introduction to Microservices

Microservices architecture is a modern approach to building applications, contrasting significantly with the traditional monolithic architecture. This document outlines the fundamental concepts and practical steps involved in understanding and implementing microservices.

## Definition of Microservices

Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of small, autonomous services modeled around a business domain. Each service is:
- **Self-contained:** Encapsulating its own logic and data storage.
- **Independently Deployable:** Can be developed, deployed, and scaled without affecting other services.
- **Business-Oriented:** Focused on a specific business capability or function.

## Key Differences Between Monolithic and Microservices Architectures

### Monolithic Architecture:
- A single codebase or multiple codebases deployed as one entity.
- Runs on one server and scales as a single unit.
- Modularity in code does not equate to modularity in deployment.

### Microservices Architecture:
- Applications are broken down into smaller, independent services.
- Each service is deployed independently.
- Promotes scalability and modularity at runtime, not just in code.

## Core Principles of Microservices

1. **Independent Deployment:** Each microservice is deployed independently, allowing for isolated changes and scaling.
2. **Service Communication:** Microservices must interact cohesively to achieve functionality.
3. **Service Discovery:** Dynamic mechanisms enable services to locate and communicate without hard-coded endpoints.

## Workshop Agenda

This workshop focuses on building a sample application composed of four microservices that work together. The primary goals include:

1. **Creating Microservices:** Learn to split a monolithic application into smaller microservices.
2. **Facilitating Communication:** Enable interaction between microservices through basic and advanced methods such as:
   - Hardcoded calls between services.
   - Implementing service discovery.

## Technologies and Patterns

Microservices architecture involves numerous technologies and patterns, such as:

### Technologies:
- **Spring Cloud:** A comprehensive toolkit for building microservices in Java. It includes various components with specific use cases.

### Patterns:
- **Service Registry and Discovery:** Services dynamically register and locate one another.
- **Circuit Breaker:** Handles failures gracefully by preventing cascading issues.
- **Load Balancing:** Distributes traffic efficiently across services.

## Conclusion

Microservices represent a transformative shift in application development. By breaking down monoliths into independently deployable units, they enhance scalability, flexibility, and maintainability. However, this approach introduces new complexities that require a solid grasp of technologies and patterns. This workshop provides the foundational skills to begin exploring and implementing microservices effectively.
