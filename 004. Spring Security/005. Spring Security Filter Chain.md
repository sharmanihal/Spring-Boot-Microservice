# FilterChain & Security Configuration DSL

Weâ€™ll start covering Spring Security a bit unconventionally, by going in the reverse direction from the previous chapter, starting with Spring Securityâ€™s FilterChain.

## Springâ€™s DefaultSecurityFilterChain

Letâ€™s assume you set up Spring Security correctly and then boot up your web application. Youâ€™ll see the following log message:

```
2020-02-25 10:24:27.875  INFO 11116 --- [           main] o.s.s.web.DefaultSecurityFilterChain     : Creating filter chain: any request, [org.springframework.security.web.context.request.async.WebAsyncManagerIntegrationFilter@46320c9a, org.springframework.security.web.context.SecurityContextPersistenceFilter@4d98e41b, org.springframework.security.web.header.HeaderWriterFilter@52bd9a27, org.springframework.security.web.csrf.CsrfFilter@51c65a43, org.springframework.security.web.authentication.logout.LogoutFilter@124d26ba, org.springframework.security.web.authentication.UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter@61e86192, org.springframework.security.web.authentication.ui.DefaultLoginPageGeneratingFilter@10980560, org.springframework.security.web.authentication.ui.DefaultLogoutPageGeneratingFilter@32256e68, org.springframework.security.web.authentication.www.BasicAuthenticationFilter@52d0f583, org.springframework.security.web.savedrequest.RequestCacheAwareFilter@5696c927, org.springframework.security.web.servletapi.SecurityContextHolderAwareRequestFilter@5f025000, org.springframework.security.web.authentication.AnonymousAuthenticationFilter@5e7abaf7, org.springframework.security.web.session.SessionManagementFilter@681c0ae6, org.springframework.security.web.access.ExceptionTranslationFilter@15639d09, org.springframework.security.web.access.intercept.FilterSecurityInterceptor@4f7be6c8]|
```

If you expand that one line into a list, it looks like Spring Security does not just install one filter, instead it installs a whole filter chain consisting of 15 (!) different filters.

So, when an HTTPRequest comes in, it will go through all these 15 filters, before your request finally hits your `@RestControllers`. The order is important, too, starting at the top of that list and going down to the bottom.

## Analyzing Springâ€™s FilterChain

It would go too far to have a detailed look at every filter of this chain, but here are the explanations for a few of those filters. Feel free to look at Spring Securityâ€™s source code to understand the other filters.

- **BasicAuthenticationFilter**: Tries to find a Basic Auth HTTP Header on the request and if found, tries to authenticate the user with the headerâ€™s username and password.
- **UsernamePasswordAuthenticationFilter**: Tries to find a username/password request parameter/POST body and if found, tries to authenticate the user with those values.
- **DefaultLoginPageGeneratingFilter**: Generates a login page for you, if you donâ€™t explicitly disable that feature. THIS filter is why you get a default login page when enabling Spring Security.
- **DefaultLogoutPageGeneratingFilter**: Generates a logout page for you, if you donâ€™t explicitly disable that feature.
- **FilterSecurityInterceptor**: Does your authorization.

So with these couple of filters, Spring Security provides you with a login/logout page, the ability to login with Basic Auth or Form Logins, as well as a couple of additional goodies like the CsrfFilter that we are going to have a look at later.

## Half-Time Break

Those filters, for a large part, are Spring Security. Not more, not less. They do all the work. Whatâ€™s left for you is to configure how they do their work, i.e., which URLs to protect, which to ignore, and what database tables to use for authentication.

Hence, we need to have a look at how to configure Spring Security, next.
