# Integrating External APIs into Microservices

## Overview
In this session, we explored how to integrate an external API, **Movie DB**, into a microservice architecture. The goal is to fetch live movie information based on movie IDs and display it to the users. This integration serves as an example of how external API calls can introduce points of failure into a system, which is useful for understanding fault tolerance in microservices.

## The Movie DB API
- **What is Movie DB?**
  - A platform similar to IMDb, offering an API to fetch movie-related information such as title, overview, and more.
  - Requires user registration to obtain an API key for making requests.

- **Using the API:**
  - The API provides endpoints to fetch movie details using either the movie name or movie ID.
  - Example request: `/movie/550?api_key=YOUR_API_KEY`
  - The response contains fields like `title` and `overview`, which are used in the microservice.

## Adding Movie DB to the Microservice

### Steps:
1. **Integrate External API Call:**
   - Use the `RestTemplate` in the `Movie Info Service` to make external calls to the Movie DB API.
   - Example code snippet:
     ```java
     MovieSummary movieSummary = restTemplate.getForObject(
         "https://api.themoviedb.org/3/movie/" + movieId + "?api_key=" + apiKey,
         MovieSummary.class
     );
     ```

     MovieSummary Class:
     To map the Json property to the java variable we have to use @JsonProperty annotation.
     ```java
     public class MovieSummary {

        @JsonProperty("Title")
        private String title;
        @JsonProperty("Plot")
        private String plot;
     }
   ```
   

3. **Configure API Key:**
   - Store the API key in the `application.properties` file of the `Movie Info Service`.
   - Retrieve the key using the `@Value` annotation in the service code.
     ```properties
     api.key=YOUR_API_KEY
     ```
     ```java
     @Value("${api.key}")
     private String apiKey;
     ```

4. **Return Movie Information:**
   - Map the API response to a POJO (Plain Old Java Object) with properties like `title` and `plot`.
   - Use these fields to build the response for the `Movie Info Service`.

### Example Output:
- **API Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Fight Club",
    "plot": "An insomniac office worker and a devil-may-care soap maker form an underground fight club."
  }
  ```
- **Service Response:**
  ```json
  {
    "movieId": 550,
    "title": "Fight Club",
    "plot": "An insomniac office worker and a devil-may-care soap maker form an underground fight club."
  }
  ```

## Architecture Updates
- **Original Setup:**
  - Three services: `Catalog Service`, `Movie Info Service`, and `Ratings Data Service`.
  - Hardcoded movie ratings and IDs were used.

- **New Addition:**
  - The `Movie Info Service` now makes an external API call to fetch live movie details from Movie DB.
  - **Flow:**
    1. `Catalog Service` requests movie details for a user.
    2. `Movie Info Service` calls Movie DB API to fetch live movie information.
    3. Response is returned to the user with real-time data.

## Key Learnings
1. **External Calls Increase Points of Failure:**
   - The more external dependencies a system has, the higher the chances of failure.
   - This integration helps us understand fault tolerance mechanisms for such scenarios.

2. **API Key Management:**
   - Securely store and retrieve API keys from configuration files or environment variables.

3. **Dynamic Data vs. Hardcoded Values:**
   - Replacing hardcoded movie information with live data improves user experience and showcases the practical use of APIs.

## Next Steps
- Test fault tolerance by introducing deliberate failures in the external API call.
- Implement circuit breakers (e.g., Hystrix) to handle failures gracefully.
- Explore advanced patterns for external API integration.

## Conclusion
By integrating the Movie DB API, we enhanced the `Movie Info Service` to provide live movie data, making it more dynamic and realistic. This session demonstrated how to handle external API calls and the importance of fault tolerance in microservices. Letâ€™s continue to build on this foundation in future sessions!
