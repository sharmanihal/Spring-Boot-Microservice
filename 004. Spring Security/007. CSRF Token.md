### **1. CSRF Token Generation and Reception**
- **Login**: When you log in to a web application, the server generates a **CSRF token** for your session. This token is then sent to the client (your browser).
- **How it's sent**: 
  - The CSRF token can be included in various ways, but commonly, it is:
    - Included in a hidden **HTML form field**.
    - Sent in a **meta tag** in the HTML, which JavaScript can read.

### **2. CSRF Token Usage**
- **How to use it**:
  - Whenever you make a **state-changing request** (like a POST, PUT, or DELETE request), the CSRF token must be **explicitly included** with the request. It does **not** get automatically added by the browser.
  - If you're submitting a **form**, the CSRF token is typically added as a hidden input field within the form:
    ```html
    <form method="POST" action="/submit">
      <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="abcdef123456">
      <!-- Other form fields -->
      <input type="submit" value="Submit">
    </form>
    ```
  - For **AJAX requests**, the CSRF token is usually sent in a **custom HTTP header** or in the request body:
    ```javascript
    fetch('/submit', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json',
        'X-CSRF-Token': 'abcdef123456' // Token explicitly included
      },
      body: JSON.stringify({ data: 'somevalue' })
    });
    ```

### **3. Session ID vs. CSRF Token**
- **Session ID**:
  - The session ID (stored in cookies) is automatically sent with every request to the server for the **same origin** (the domain you are logged into).
  - This is how the server identifies your active session and knows you are logged in.
  - Cookies are **automatically attached by the browser** with each request (no need to include them explicitly in the request).
- **CSRF Token**:
  - Unlike the session ID, **CSRF tokens are not automatically sent** with requests.
  - **You must explicitly add the CSRF token** in the body or headers of requests that modify data (POST, PUT, DELETE).
  - This ensures that only **legitimate requests** from your session (that have the correct CSRF token) are processed by the server.
  - This is important because it **prevents malicious websites** from performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user (since the attacker won't have access to the correct CSRF token).

### **4. CSRF Token Validation on the Server**
- When the server receives a state-changing request (e.g., a form submission or an AJAX request), it checks:
  1. The **CSRF token** sent with the request.
  2. The **stored CSRF token** associated with the user’s session (typically stored in the server-side session).
- If the tokens match, the request is considered valid and processed.
- If the tokens don't match or the CSRF token is missing, the server rejects the request, preventing CSRF attacks.

### **5. Why This Protects Against CSRF Attacks**
- **Session ID alone** is not sufficient to prevent CSRF attacks. Since the session ID is sent automatically by the browser with every request, a malicious website could trick your browser into making a request to a server where you're logged in.
- **CSRF token** provides additional security by ensuring that the request is intentionally made by the user (i.e., the user is sending the request with a **valid token**).
- Since the attacker doesn't have access to the CSRF token (due to the **same-origin policy**), they can't forge valid requests on your behalf.

Note: We can disable CSRF if we keep our HTTP Sessions Stateless.

### **In Summary:**
- **Login** → Server sends the **CSRF token** to the client.
- **State-changing requests** (POST, PUT, DELETE) require you to **explicitly include** the CSRF token in the request.
- The **CSRF token** is usually provided by the server (in the form of a hidden field in a form or in a meta tag for JavaScript to access).
- **Session ID** is automatically included in cookies with every request, but **CSRF tokens** must be explicitly added by the client.
- The **CSRF token** helps protect against malicious websites sending requests on your behalf (since the attacker won't have access to the valid token).
